-Target activity-
You are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.

-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.

-Steps-
1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.
2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.
For each claim, extract the following information:
- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.
- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.
- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type
- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.
- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.
- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.
- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.

Format each claim as (<subject_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<object_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_type>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_status>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_start_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_end_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_description>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_source>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Examples-
Example 1:
Entity specification: employee, manager
Claim description: Claims about employee-manager reporting issues.
Text: Name: Ishita Mann, Designation: Automation Engineer, Manager: Rasha Baral, Location: Pune, Date of Birth: 30-05-1995

Output:
(ISHITA MANN{tuple_delimiter}RASHA BARAL{tuple_delimiter}REPORTING ISSUE{tuple_delimiter}SUSPECTED{tuple_delimiter}NONE{tuple_delimiter}NONE{tuple_delimiter}It is suspected that Ishita Mann reported issues with her manager Rasha Baral, based on internal team reports and employee feedback.{tuple_delimiter}Ishita Mann reports to Rasha Baral as her manager.)
{completion_delimiter}

Example 2:
Entity specification: Ishita Mann, Automation Engineer, Rasha Baral
Claim description: Issues related to employee reporting to a manager and confirmation of current employment status.
Text: Name: Ishita Mann, Designation: Automation Engineer, Manager: Rasha Baral, Location: Pune, Date of Birth: 30-05-1995

Output:
(ISHITA MANN{tuple_delimiter}RASHA BARAL{tuple_delimiter}REPORTING ISSUE{tuple_delimiter}SUSPECTED{tuple_delimiter}NONE{tuple_delimiter}NONE{tuple_delimiter}It is suspected that Ishita Mann reported issues with her manager Rasha Baral, based on internal team reports and employee feedback.{tuple_delimiter}Ishita Mann reports to Rasha Baral as her manager.)
{record_delimiter}
(ISHITA MANN{tuple_delimiter}AUTOMATION ENGINEER{tuple_delimiter}CURRENT EMPLOYEE{tuple_delimiter}TRUE{tuple_delimiter}NONE{tuple_delimiter}NONE{tuple_delimiter}Ishita Mann is confirmed as currently employed in the role of Automation Engineer, actively contributing to her team.{tuple_delimiter}Ishita Mann's job designation is Automation Engineer.)
