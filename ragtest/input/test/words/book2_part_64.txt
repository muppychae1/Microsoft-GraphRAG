set himself afire three times already. But in spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of, and never was so jolly in my life. Excuse the remark, but living among boys, I can't help using their expressions now and then." "Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one," began Mrs. March, frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of countenance. "Not half so good as yours, mother. Here it is, and we never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done," cried Jo, with the loving impetuosity which she never could outgrow. "I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year," said Amy softly. "A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for it, Marmee dear," added Meg's tender voice. Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility,-- "O, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this!"

Transcriber's Notes: Project Gutenberg has two versions of Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. Original Edition Illustrated Edition Welcome to the Project Gutenberg Illustrated Edition of Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, published by Little, Brown, and Company. Some versions of the book, such as this one, use the full title of the book from the title page, _Little Women; Or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy_. We used the version of the book from Little, Brown, and Company: copyright 1896, for this transcription. A scanned copy of this book is available through the internet archive, courtesy of the New York Public Library. A copy of the first version of the novel, published in 1869, was consulted for emendations, the proper rendering of words hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing, and other issues in transcribing the novel. We are not trying to change this version of the novel back to the 1869 novel, but correct the errors that were made in re-transcribing and updating the text. Passages in italics were indicated by _underscores_. Passages in bold were indicated by =equal signs=. Small caps were replaced with ALL CAPS. Throughout the dialogues, there were words used to mimic accents of the speakers. Those words were retained as-is. Errors in punctuations and hyphenation were not corrected unless otherwise noted below. A note about spacing of illustrations: If there are four lines above the illustration, then the illustration was at the top of a new chapter. If there are four lines below the illustration, then the illustration was at the end of a chapter. If there is two lines between a chapter heading and the illustration, then the illustration was an inline illustration (usually a drop-cap illustration). On page vii, in the Table of Contents, change page 7 to 1 for the beginning of Chapter One. In the List of Illustrations, for the illustration on page 147, "postmistress" was replaced with "post-mistress". In the List of Illustrations, for the illustration on page 235, "tea-pot" was replaced with "teapot". On page 30, the punctuation after 'stained they are' may be a colon, but on page 41 of the 1869 book, it is a semicolon. We used the semi-colon. On page 34, transcribe red-headed with the hyphen. See page 44 of the 1869 novel. On page 40, a period was added after "room where old Mr". See page 50 of the 1869 novel. On page 41, the semicolon after "Laurie went on the box" was replaced with a comma. See page 52 of the 1869 novel. On page 62, mantel-piece was transcribed with the hyphen. See Page 75 of the 1869 novel. On page 63, checked the clause "and I've been trying to do it this ever so long." It is written the same way on page 77 of the 1869 book. No change was made. On page 64, add period after "red and shining with merriment." See page 79 of the 1869 book. On page 68, changed weet to sweet in 'the damp weet air.' See page 84 of the 1869 novel. On page 79, add comma after I remain in the letter. See page 95 of the 1869 novel. On page 84, ferrule was an adjustment from the 1869 book, which only used one r in spelling the word (see page 101). Webster's dictionary spells ferrule with two rs. On page 109, a period was added after "and the old man quite dotes on them". See page 130 of the 1869 novel. On page 109, a period was added after "asked another voice". See page 131 of the 1869 novel. On page 112, change colon to semicolon after "if you don't;"--see page 134 of the 1869 novel. On page 113, transcribe ear-rings with the hyphen. See page 135 of the 1869 novel. On Page 123, "One thing remember, my girls:" is written as it appears in the 1896 novel. A comma instead of a colon was used after my girls in the 1869 novel (see page 146). "One thing =to= remember," may work better today, or even "Remember one thing," but we left this as Ms. Alcott wrote it. On Page 124, the P. C. is the Pickwick Club from a novel by Charles Dickens. Samuel Pickwick, Tracy Tupman, Augustus Snodgrass, and Nathaniel Winkle were introdued by Charles Dickens in the first chapter of The Pickwick Papers. Samuel Weller makes his first appearance in Chapter Ten of that novel. On page 128, in the Pickwick Portfolio, there is no period after "it is nearly school time" in N. Winkle's letter. This period was also missing on page 151 of the 1869 novel. The missing period was intentional. On page 135, the ambiguous punctuation after "Oh, dear, no!" is an exclamation point. See page 160 of the 1869 novel. On page 146, change buttonholes to button-holes. On page 173 of the 1869 novel, this word was hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing. There were seven other occurrences of button-hole or button-holes in the novel. We therefore used the hyphen. On page 150, "Betty" was replaced with "Bethy". This error was also made in the 1869 novel--see page 177. The character addressed is Beth. On page 158, a period was added after "still kneeling". See page 187 of the 1869 novel. On page 160, "hard a lee" is spelled the same way in the 1869 novel (see page 189) and this novel. We left this as is. On page 166, a comma was added after "Meg" in "Meg obediently following". See page 195 of the 1869 book. On page 185, "receptable" was replaced with "receptacle". See page 217 of the 1869 novel. On page 185, transcribe door-way with the hyphen. See page 217 of the 1869 novel. Also, change doorway to door-way a few lines down the same page. See page 218 of the 1869 novel. On page 189, the comma after "published every day" was replaced with a period. See page 225 of 1869 book. On page 198, the clause: "Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine:" was written as it appeared in the 1896 novel. The clause ended in with a semi-colon in the 1869 book (see page 234). On page 200, change needlework to needle-work. See page 236 of the 1869 novel. On page 209, "turnovers" was replaced with "turn-overs". See page 246 of the 1869 novel. On page 214, the single quotation mark before "Head Nurse of Ward" was replaced with a double quotation mark. See page 252 of the 1869 novel. On page 218, "Year's ago" was replaced with "Years ago". See page 257 of the 1869 novel. On page 219, "ask him so help" was replaced with "ask him to help". See page 257 of the 1869 novel. On page 219, add period after "give it to her." See page 258 of the 1869 novel. On page 230, "two, A.M." is spelled the same way, with the comma, in this book and in the 1869 novel (on page 272). The comma was retained. On page 244, "postscrips" was replaced with "postscripts". See page 287 of the 1869 novel. On page 279, place exclamation point after won't in 'No, I won't!' See page 329 in the 1869 novel. On page 286, "actingly" was replaced with "acting". See page 337 of the 1869 novel. On page 288, add comma after mankind in the clause "who felt at peace with all mankind even his mischievous pupil." See page 339 of the 1869 novel. On page 294, transcribe gray-headed with the hyphen. See page 5 of the 1869 novel. On page 295, add a comma after salary in the phrase "with an honestly-earned salary." See page 7 of the 1869 book. Checked the clause "But once get used to these slight blemishes" on page 297. The sentence appears the same way on page 10 of the 1869 novel. Checked the clause "People who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose" on page 298. The sentence has a comma after them, but is otherwise written the same way on page 11 of the 1869 novel. On page 299, transcribe door-handles with the hyphen. See page 13 of the 1869 novel. On page 339, "shortcomings" was replaced with "short-comings". See page 62 of the 1869 novel. On page 345, "furbelows and notions" was written "furbelows and quinny-dingles" in the 1869 novel. See page 59 of the 1869 novel. We made no change, and only point this out because quinny-dingles is such a memorable word that those intimate with the novel may notice the change. On page 353, change snowbank to snow-bank. See page 79 of the 1869 novel. On page 363, a double quotation mark was added before "Cross-patch, draw the latch". See page 91 of the 1869 book. On page 379, change period after Jo to a comma in the
