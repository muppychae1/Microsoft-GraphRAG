There was nothing the young gentleman\nwould have liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back\nafter the scolding he had received; pride forbid, and whenever the\nlonging grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating the\nwords that had made the deepest impression, \"I despise you;\" \"Go and do\nsomething splendid that will _make_ her love you.\"\n\nLaurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought\nhimself to confess that he _had_ been selfish and lazy; but then when a\nman has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries\ntill he has lived it down. He felt that his blighted affections were\nquite dead now; and, though he should never cease to be a faithful\nmourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously. Jo\n_wouldn't_ love him, but he might _make_ her respect and admire him by\ndoing something which should prove that a girl's \"No\" had not spoilt his\nlife. He had always meant to do something, and Amy's advice was quite\nunnecessary. He had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted\naffections were decently interred; that being done, he felt that he was\nready to \"hide his stricken heart, and still toil on.\"\n\nAs Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie\nresolved to embalm his love-sorrow in music, and compose a Requiem which\nshould harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of every hearer. Therefore\nthe next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody,\nand ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical friends,\nand fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself.\nBut, whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or music\ntoo ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that the Requiem\nwas beyond him, just at present. It was evident that his mind was not in\nworking order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying; for often in the\nmiddle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself humming a dancing\ntune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the\nstout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the\ntime being.\n\nThen he tried an Opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning;\nbut here, again, unforeseen difficulties beset him. He wanted Jo for his\nheroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender\nrecollections and romantic visions of his love. But memory turned\ntraitor; and, as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would\nonly recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in\nthe most unsentimental aspects,--beating mats with her head tied up in\na bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa-pillow, or throwing cold\nwater over his passion _à la_ Gummidge,--and an irresistible laugh\nspoilt the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn't be\nput into the Opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a \"Bless\nthat girl, what a torment she is!\" and a clutch at his hair, as became a\ndistracted composer.\n\nWhen he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to\nimmortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging\nreadiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair,\nwas enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his\nmind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, and\nblue ribbons. He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he\ntook her for his heroine, and grew quite fond of her, as well he might;\nfor he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted\nher, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated any mortal\nwoman.\n\nThanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but\ngradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he\nsat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas\nand refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state\nthat winter. He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and was\nconscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. \"It's\ngenius simmering, perhaps. I'll let it simmer, and see what comes of\nit,\" he said, with a secret suspicion, all the while, that it wasn't\ngenius, but something far more common. Whatever it was, it simmered to\nsome purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory\nlife, began to long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and\nbody, and finally came to the wise conclusion that every one who loved\nmusic was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart's grand operas,\nsplendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own,\nplayed a few of the best parts, sat staring up at the busts of\nMendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again; then\nsuddenly he tore up his music-sheets, one\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
