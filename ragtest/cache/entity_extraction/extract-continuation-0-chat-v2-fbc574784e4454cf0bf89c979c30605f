I'm spoilt! I can't go! My hair, oh,\nmy hair!\" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her\nforehead.\n\n\"Just my luck! you shouldn't have asked me to do it; I always spoil\neverything. I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made a\nmess,\" groaned poor Jo, regarding the black pancakes with tears of\nregret.\n\n\"It isn't spoilt; just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come\non your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I've\nseen many girls do it so,\" said Amy consolingly.\n\n\"Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair alone,\"\ncried Meg petulantly.\n\n\"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,\"\nsaid Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.\n\nAfter various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the\nunited exertions of the family Jo's hair was got up and her dress on.\nThey looked very well in their simple suits,--Meg in silvery drab, with\na blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin; Jo in maroon, with\na stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for\nher only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one\nsoiled one, and all pronounced the effect \"quite easy and fine.\" Meg's\nhigh-heeled slippers were very tight, and hurt her, though she would not\nown it, and Jo's nineteen hair-pins all seemed stuck straight into her\nhead, which was not exactly comfortable; but, dear me, let us be elegant\nor die!\n\n\"Have a good time, dearies!\" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went\ndaintily down the walk. \"Don't eat much supper, and come away at eleven,\nwhen I send Hannah for you.\" As the gate clashed behind them, a voice\ncried from a window,--\n\n\"Girls, girls! _have_ you both got nice pocket-handkerchiefs?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\" cried Jo, adding,\nwith a laugh, as they went on, \"I do believe Marmee would ask that if we\nwere all running away from an earthquake.\"\n\n\"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady\nis always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,\" replied Meg,\nwho had a good many little \"aristocratic tastes\" of her own.\n\n\"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash\nright? and does my hair look _very_ bad?\" said Meg, as she turned from\nthe glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing-room, after a prolonged prink.\n\n\"I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind\nme by a wink, will you?\" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her\nhead a hasty brush.\n\n\"No, winking isn't lady-like; I'll lift my eyebrows if anything is\nwrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulders straight,\nand take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to any\none: it isn't the thing.\"\n\n\"How _do_ you learn all the proper ways? I never can.

Meg knew Sallie, and was at her\nease very soon; but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish\ngossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt\nas much out of place as a colt in a flower-garden. Half a dozen jovial\nlads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she\nlonged to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life.\nShe telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly\nthat she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the\ngroup near her dwindled away, till she was left alone. She could not\nroam about and amuse herself, for the burnt breadth would show, so she\nstared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began.
