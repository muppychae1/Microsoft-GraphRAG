She's engaged. Now then.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it; that's one of your foolish extravagances,--sending\nflowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two pins,\" continued\nJo reprovingly.\n\n\"Sensible girls, for whom I do care whole papers of pins, won't let me\nsend them 'flowers and things,' so what can I do? My feelings must have\na _went_.\"\n\n\"Mother doesn't approve of flirting, even in fun; and you do flirt\ndesperately, Teddy.\"\n\n\"I'd give anything if I could answer, 'So do you.' As I can't, I'll\nmerely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little game, if\nall parties understand that it's only play.\"\n\n\"Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done. I've\ntried, because one feels awkward in company, not to do as everybody else\nis doing; but I don't seem to get on,\" said Jo, forgetting to play\nMentor.\n\n\"Take lessons of Amy; she has a regular talent for it.\"\n\n\"Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far. I\nsuppose it's natural to some people to please without trying, and others\nto always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you can't flirt; it's really refreshing to see a sensible,\nstraightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of\nherself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I know really do go on\nat such a rate I'm ashamed of them. They don't mean any harm, I'm sure;\nbut if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward, they'd mend\ntheir ways, I fancy.\"\n\n\"They do the same; and, as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows\nget the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit. If you\nbehaved properly, they would; but, knowing you like their nonsense, they\nkeep it up, and then you blame them.\"\n\n\"Much you know about it, ma'am,\" said Laurie, in a superior tone. \"We\ndon't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did sometimes.\nThe pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully,\namong gentlemen. Bless your innocent soul! If you could be in my place\nfor a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my\nword, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls, I always want to say\nwith our friend Cock Robin,--\n\n        \"'Out upon you, fie upon you,\n           Bold-faced jig!'\"\n\nIt was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between\nLaurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his very\nnatural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society\nshowed him many samples. Jo knew that \"young Laurence\" was regarded as a\nmost eligible _parti_ by worldly mammas, was much smiled upon by their\ndaughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb\nof him; so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be spoilt,\nand rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in\nmodest girls. Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone, she said,\ndropping her voice, \"If you _must_ have a 'went,' Teddy, go and devote\nyourself to one of the 'pretty, modest girls' whom you do respect, and\nnot waste your time with the silly ones.\"\n\n\"You really advise it?\" and Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of\nanxiety and merriment in his face.\n\n\"Yes, I do; but you'd better wait till you are through college, on the\nwhole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime. You're not half\ngood enough for--well, whoever the modest girl maybe,\" and Jo looked a\nlittle queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.\n\n\"That I'm not!\" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite\nnew to him, as he dropped his eyes, and absently wound Jo's apron-tassel\nround his finger.\n\n\"Mercy on us, this will never do,\" thought Jo; adding aloud, \"Go and\nsing to me. I'm dying for some music, and always like yours.\"\n\n\"I'd rather stay here, thank you.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't; there isn't room. Go and make yourself useful, since\nyou are too big to be ornamental. I thought you hated to be tied to a\nwoman's apron-string?\" retorted Jo, quoting certain rebellious words of\nhis own.\n\n\"Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!\" and Laurie gave an audacious\ntweak at the tassel.\n\n\"Are you going?\" demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.\n\nHe fled at once, and the minute it was well \"Up with the bonnets of\nbonnie Dundee,\" she slipped away, to return no more till the young\ngentleman had departed in high dudgeon.\n\n          [Illustration: Up with the Bonnets of Bonnie Dundee]\n\nJo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the sound\nof a stifled\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MISS RANDAL<|>PERSON<|>Miss Randal is a woman who Teddy has sent bouquets to)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is advising Teddy on his interactions with women)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEDDY<|>PERSON<|>Teddy is being advised by Jo on his interactions with women)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is mentioned as having a talent for flirting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is being advised by Jo on his interactions with women)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEDDY<|>MISS RANDAL<|>Teddy has sent bouquets to Miss Randal<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>TEDDY<|>Jo is advising Teddy on his interactions with women<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>AMY<|>Jo mentions Amy as having a talent for flirting<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>LAURIE<|>Jo is advising Laurie on his interactions with women<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>JO<|>Laurie is being advised by Jo on his interactions with women<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
