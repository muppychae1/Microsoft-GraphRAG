There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but\nthe young man took little notice of them, except to glance, now and\nthen, at some blonde girl, or lady in blue. Presently he strolled out of\nthe promenade, and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided\nwhether to go and listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to\nwander along the beach toward Castle Hill. The quick trot of ponies'\nfeet made him look up, as one of the little carriages, containing a\nsingle lady, came rapidly down the street. The lady was young, blonde,\nand dressed in blue. He stared a minute, then his whole face woke up,\nand, waving his hat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.\n\n\"O Laurie, is it really you? I thought you'd never come!\" cried Amy,\ndropping the reins, and holding out both hands, to the great\nscandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's steps,\nlest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these\n\"mad English.\"\n\n\"I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you,\nand here I am.\"\n\n\"How is your grandfather? When did you come? Where are you staying?\"\n\n\"Very well--last night--at the Chauvain. I called at your hotel, but you\nwere all out.\"\n\n\"I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin! Get in, and we can\ntalk at our ease; I was going for a drive, and longing for company.\nFlo's saving up for to-night.\"\n\n\"What happens then, a ball?\"\n\n\"A Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there, and\nthey give it in honor of the day. You'll go with us, of course? Aunt\nwill be charmed.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Where now?\" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his arms,\na proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive; for her\nparasol-whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs, afforded her\ninfinite satisfaction.\n\n\"I'm going to the banker's first, for letters, and then to Castle Hill;\nthe view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever\nbeen there?\"\n\n\"Often, years ago; but I don't mind having a look at it.\"\n\n\"Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your\ngrandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.\"\n\n\"Yes, I spent a month there, and then joined him in Paris, where he has\nsettled for the winter. He has friends there, and finds plenty to amuse\nhim; so I go and come, and we get on capitally.\"\n\n\"That's a sociable arrangement,\" said Amy, missing something in Laurie's\nmanner, though she couldn't tell what.\n\n\"Why, you see he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still; so we each\nsuit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with him, and he\nenjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that some one is glad to see\nme when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old hole, isn't it?\" he\nadded, with a look of disgust, as they drove along the boulevard to the\nPlace Napoleon, in the old city.\n\n\"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind. The river and the hills are\ndelicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross-streets are my\ndelight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass; it's\ngoing to the Church of St. John.\"\n\nWhile Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their\ncanopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some brotherhood\nin blue, chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt a new sort\nof shyness steal over her; for he was changed, and she could not find\nthe merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside her. He was\nhandsomer than ever, and greatly improved, she thought; but now that the\nflush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired and\nspiritless,--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a\nyear or two of prosperous life should have made him. She couldn't\nunderstand it, and did not venture to ask questions; so she shook her\nhead, and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the\narches of the Paglioni bridge, and vanished in the church.\n\n\"_Que pensez vous_?\" she said, airing her French, which had improved in\nquantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.\n\n\"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is\ncharming,\" replied Laurie, bowing, with his hand on his heart, and an\nadmiring look.\n\nShe blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy\nher like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he\npromenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was\n\"altogether jolly,\" with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the\nhead. She didn't like the new tone; for, though not _blasé_, it sounded\nindifferent in spite of the look.\n\n\"If that's\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a young lady who is blonde and dressed in blue, driving white ponies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LITTLE CARRIAGE<|>EVENT<|>A carriage containing a single lady, young, blonde, and dressed in blue)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a young man who is described as handsome and tired)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH MAMMA<|>PERSON<|>A French mother who is scandalized by the free manners of the English)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAUVAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A hotel where Amy stays)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLO<|>PERSON<|>A person who is saving up for a Christmas party)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT<|>PERSON<|>Aunt of Amy who will be charmed to have Laurie at the Christmas party)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A place where Laurie goes for letters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTLE HILL<|>GEO<|>A location where Laurie and Amy plan to visit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERLIN<|>GEO<|>A city where Laurie spent a month before joining his grandfather in Paris)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS<|>GEO<|>City where Laurie's grandfather has settled for the winter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACE NAPOLEON<|>GEO<|>A location in the old city where Laurie and Amy drive along)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHURCH OF ST.
