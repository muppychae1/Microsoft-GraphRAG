She'd never forgive\nus if Beth--well, if anything happened, you know. So I got grandpa to\nsay it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the office\nyesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my head off\nwhen I proposed a telegram. I never _can_ bear to be 'lorded over;' so\nthat settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and\nthe late train is in at two, A.M. I shall go for her; and you've only\ngot to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet, till that blessed\nlady gets here.\"\n\n\"Laurie, you're an angel! How shall I ever thank you?\"\n\n\"Fly at me again; I rather like it,\" said Laurie, looking\nmischievous,--a thing he had not done for a fortnight.\n\n\"No, thank you. I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don't\ntease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night. Bless you,\nTeddy, bless you!\"\n\nJo had backed into a corner; and, as she finished her speech, she\nvanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a\ndresser, and told the assembled cats that she was \"happy, oh, _so_\nhappy!\" while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made rather a neat\nthing of it.\n\n\"That's the interferingest chap I ever see; but I forgive him, and do\nhope Mrs. March is coming on right away,\" said Hannah, with an air of\nrelief, when Jo told the good news.\n\nMeg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set\nthe sick-room in order, and Hannah \"knocked up a couple of pies in case\nof company unexpected.\" A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the\nhouse, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms.\nEverything appeared to feel the hopeful change; Beth's bird began to\nchirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's bush in the\nwindow; the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness; and every time\nthe girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one\nanother, whispering encouragingly, \"Mother's coming, dear! mother's\ncoming!\" Every one rejoiced but Beth; she lay in that heavy stupor,\nalike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous\nsight,--the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands so\nweak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and the once pretty,\nwell-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day she\nlay so, only rousing now and then to mutter, \"Water!\" with lips so\nparched they could hardly shape the word; all day Jo and Meg hovered\nover her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and mother; and\nall day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged\nslowly by. But night came at last; and every time the clock struck, the\nsisters, still sitting on either side the bed, looked at each other with\nbrightening eyes, for each hour brought help nearer. The doctor had been\nin to say that some change, for better or worse, would probably take\nplace about midnight, at which time he would return.\n\nHannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot, and fell\nfast asleep; Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling that\nhe would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's anxious\ncountenance as she entered; Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest,\nbut staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black\neyes beautifully soft and clear.\n\nThe girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they\nkept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes\nto us in hours like those.\n\n\"If God spares Beth I never will complain again,\" whispered Meg\nearnestly.\n\n\"If God spares Beth I'll try to love and serve Him all my life,\"\nanswered Jo, with equal fervor.\n\n\"I wish I had no heart, it aches so,\" sighed Meg, after a pause.\n\n\"If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shall get\nthrough it,\" added her sister despondently.\n\nHere the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching\nBeth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was\nstill as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep\nhush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale\nshadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An hour went by, and\nnothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station.\nAnother hour,--still no one came; and anxious fears of delay in the\nstorm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at\nWashington, haunted the poor girls.\n\nIt was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary\nthe world looked in its winding-sheet of snow, heard a movement by the\nbed, and, turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's\neasy-chair, with her face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo,\nas she thought, \"Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.\"\n\nShe was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
