He was\nstaring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she\nthought; for, though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest\neyes made her blush, and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her\nconfusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to\nLaurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.\n\n\"Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head! I won't care for\nit, or let it change me a bit,\" thought Meg, and rustled across the room\nto shake hands with her friend.\n\n\"I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't,\" she said, with her most\ngrown-up air.\n\n\"Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did;\" answered\nLaurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her\nmaternal tone.\n\n\"What shall you tell her?\" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his\nopinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him, for the first time.\n\n\"I shall say I didn't know you; for you look so grown-up, and unlike\nyourself, I'm quite afraid of you,\" he said, fumbling at his\nglove-button.\n\n\"How absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like\nit. Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?\" said Meg, bent on making him say\nwhether he thought her improved or not.\n\n\"Yes, I think she would,\" returned Laurie gravely.\n\n\"Don't you like me so?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"No, I don't,\" was the blunt reply.\n\n\"Why not?\" in an anxious tone.\n\nHe glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically\ntrimmed dress, with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,\nwhich had not a particle of his usual politeness about it.\n\n\"I don't like fuss and feathers.\"\n\nThat was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself; and Meg\nwalked away, saying petulantly,--\n\n\"You are the rudest boy I ever saw.\"\n\nFeeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window, to cool\nher cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant\ncolor. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by; and, a minute after,\nshe heard him saying to his mother,--\n\n\"They are making a fool of that little girl; I wanted you to see her,\nbut they have spoilt her entirely; she's nothing but a doll, to-night.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" sighed Meg; \"I wish I'd been sensible, and worn my own\nthings; then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so\nuncomfortable and ashamed myself.\"\n\nShe leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the\ncurtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some one\ntouched her; and, turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he said,\nwith his very best bow, and his hand out,--\n\n\"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,\" said Meg, trying to\nlook offended, and failing entirely.\n\n\"Not a bit of it; I'm dying to do it. Come, I'll be good; I don't like\nyour gown, but I do think you are--just splendid;\" and he waved his\nhands, as if words failed to express his admiration.\n\nMeg smiled and relented, and whispered, as they stood waiting to catch\nthe time,--\n\n\"Take care my skirt don't trip you up; it's the plague of my life, and I\nwas a goose to wear it.\"\n\n\"Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,\" said Laurie,\nlooking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.\n\nAway they went, fleetly and gracefully; for, having practised at home,\nthey were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant\nsight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more\nfriendly than ever after their small tiff.\n\n\"Laurie, I want you to do me a favor; will you?\" said Meg, as he stood\nfanning her, when her breath gave out, which it did very soon, though\nshe would not own why.\n\n\"Won't I!\" said Laurie, with alacrity.\n\n\"Please don't tell them at home about my dress to-night. They won't\nunderstand the joke, and it will worry mother.\"\n\n\"Then why did you do it?\" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that Meg\nhastily added,--\n\n\"I shall tell them, myself, all about it, and ''fess' to mother how\nsilly I've been. But I'd rather do it myself; so you'll not tell, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"I give you my word I won't; only what shall I say when they ask me?\"\n\n\"Just say I looked pretty well, and was having a good time.\"\n\n\"I'll say the first, with all my heart; but how about the other? You\ndon't look as if you were having a good time; are you?\" and Laurie\nlooked at her with an expression which made her answer, in a whisper,--\n\n\"No; not just now. Don't think I'm horrid; I only wanted a little fun,\nbut this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it.\"\n\n\"Here comes Ned Moffat; what does he want?\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a young man who is friends with Meg and has a playful demeanor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a young woman who is friends with Laurie and is trying to navigate social situations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLE<|>PERSON<|>Belle is a friend of Annie and is observed interacting with Laurie and Meg)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNIE<|>PERSON<|>Annie is a friend of Belle and is observed interacting with Laurie and Meg)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a friend of Meg who wanted Laurie to report back on how Meg looked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAJOR LINCOLN<|>PERSON<|>Major Lincoln is a character who comments on Meg's appearance at a social event)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NED MOFFAT<|>PERSON<|>Ned Moffat is a character who approaches Meg at the end of the text)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>LAURIE<|>Meg and Laurie have a playful interaction at a social event<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>MAJOR LINCOLN<|>Major Lincoln comments on Meg's appearance and behavior at a social event<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>NED MOFFAT<|>Ned Moffat approaches Meg at the end of the text<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>JO<|>Laurie reports back to Jo about how Meg looked at a social event<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
