Beth was worried by the confusion\nof her closet, and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at\nonce; and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy\nBrown's party was to be the next day; and now, like Flora McFlimsey, she\nhad \"nothing to wear.\" But these were mere trifles; and they assured\ntheir mother that the experiment was working finely. She smiled, said\nnothing, and, with Hannah's help, did their neglected work, keeping home\npleasant, and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was\nastonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was\nproduced by the \"resting and revelling\" process. The days kept getting\nlonger and longer; the weather was unusually variable, and so were\ntempers; an unsettled feeling possessed every one, and Satan found\nplenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury,\nMeg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily that\nshe fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes, in her attempts to\nfurbish them up à la Moffat. Jo read till her eyes gave out, and she was\nsick of books; got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a\nquarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished\nshe had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she was\nconstantly forgetting that it was to be _all play, and no work_, and\nfell back into her old ways now and then; but something in the air\naffected her, and, more than once, her tranquillity was much disturbed;\nso much so, that, on one occasion, she actually shook poor dear Joanna,\nand told her she was \"a fright.\" Amy fared worst of all, for her\nresources were small; and when her sisters left her to amuse and care\nfor herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self\na great burden. She didn't like dolls, fairy-tales were childish, and\none couldn't draw all the time; tea-parties didn't amount to much,\nneither did picnics, unless very well conducted. \"If one could have a\nfine house, full of nice girls, or go travelling, the summer would be\ndelightful; but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a\ngrown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz,\" complained Miss\nMalaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and _ennui_.\n\nNo one would own that they were tired of the experiment; but, by Friday\nnight, each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was\nnearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who\nhad a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an\nappropriate manner; so she gave Hannah a holiday, and let the girls\nenjoy the full effect of the play system.\n\nWhen they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,\nno breakfast in the dining-room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.\n\n\"Mercy on us! what _has_ happened?\" cried Jo, staring about her in\ndismay.\n\nMeg ran upstairs, and soon came back again, looking relieved, but rather\nbewildered, and a little ashamed.\n\n\"Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay\nquietly in her room all day, and let us do the best we can. It's a very\nqueer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself; but she\nsays it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble, but take\ncare of ourselves.\"\n\n\"That's easy enough, and I like the idea; I'm aching for something to\ndo--that is, some new amusement, you know,\" added Jo quickly.\n\nIn fact it _was_ an immense relief to them all to have a little work,\nand they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's\nsaying, \"Housekeeping ain't no joke.\" There was plenty of food in the\nlarder, and, while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,\nwondering, as they did so, why servants ever talked about hard work.\n\n\"I shall take some up to mother, though she said we were not to think of\nher, for she'd take care of herself,\" said Meg, who presided, and felt\nquite matronly behind the teapot.\n\nSo a tray was fitted out before any one began, and taken up, with the\ncook's compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelette\nscorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus; but Mrs. March\nreceived her repast with thanks, and laughed heartily over it after Jo\nwas gone.\n\n\"Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid; but they\nwon't suffer, and it will do them good,\" she said, producing the more\npalatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of\nthe bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt,--a motherly\nlittle deception, for which they were grateful.\n\nMany were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook\nat her failures. \"Never mind, I'll get the dinner, and be servant; you\nbe mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,\" said\nJo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.\n\nThis obliging\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is worried about her closet and learning multiple songs at once)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy regrets the damage to her frock before Katy Brown's party)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATY BROWN<|>PERSON<|>Host of a party attended by Amy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLORA MCFLIMSEY<|>PERSON<|>Reference to a character who had \"nothing to wear\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANNAH<|>PERSON<|>Assists in keeping the home running smoothly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Puts out sewing and attempts to furbish up her clothes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Reads until her eyes give out and gets fidgety)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Has a quarrel with Jo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Jo wishes she had gone with Aunt March)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISS MALAPROP<|>PERSON<|>Complains about staying at home with her sisters and a grown-up boy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
