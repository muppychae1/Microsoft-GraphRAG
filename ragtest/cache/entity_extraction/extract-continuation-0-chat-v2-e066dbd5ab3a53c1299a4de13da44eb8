Raphael's face was found\nboldly executed on the under side of the moulding-board, and Bacchus on\nthe head of a beer-barrel; a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the\nsugar-bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied\nkindlings for some time.\n\nFrom fire to oil was a natural transition for burnt fingers, and Amy\nfell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted her\nout with his cast-off palettes, brushes, and colors; and she daubed\naway, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on\nland or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken\nprizes at an agricultural fair; and the perilous pitching of her vessels\nwould have produced sea-sickness in the most nautical observer, if the\nutter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not\nconvulsed him with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys and\ndark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,\nsuggested Murillo; oily-brown shadows of faces, with a lurid streak in\nthe wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropsical infants,\nRubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange\nlightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash\nin the middle, which might be the sun or a buoy, a sailor's shirt or a\nking's robe, as the spectator pleased.\n\nCharcoal portraits came next; and the entire family hung in a row,\nlooking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coal-bin. Softened\ninto crayon sketches, they did better; for the likenesses were good, and\nAmy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were pronounced\n\"wonderfully fine.\" A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly\ncasts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off\ncloset-shelves on to people's heads. Children were enticed in as models,\ntill their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy\nto be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line,\nhowever, were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which\nquenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she undertook\nto cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an\nunearthly bumping and screaming, and running to the rescue, found the\nyoung enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed, with her foot held fast\nin a pan-full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity.\nWith much difficulty and some danger she was dug out; for Jo was so\novercome with laughter while she excavated, that her knife went too far,\ncut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt,\nat least.\n\n       [Illustration: Her foot held fast in a panful of plaster]\n\nAfter this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her\nto haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and sighing\nfor ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to\nbook \"a delicious bit,\" composed of a stone, a stump, one mushroom, and\na broken mullein-stalk, or \"a heavenly mass of clouds,\" that looked like\na choice display of feather-beds when done. She sacrificed her\ncomplexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun, to study light\nand shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose, trying after \"points of\nsight,\" or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called.\n\nIf \"genius is eternal patience,\" as Michael Angelo affirms, Amy\ncertainly had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in\nspite of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing\nthat in time she should do something worthy to be called \"high art.\"\n\nShe was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she\nhad resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she\nnever became a great artist. Here she succeeded better; for she was one\nof those happily created beings who please without effort, make friends\neverywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate\nsouls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star.\nEverybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact. She had an\ninstinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the right\nthing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and\nwas so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, \"If Amy went to\ncourt without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do.\"\n\nOne of her weaknesses was a desire to move in \"our best society,\"\nwithout being quite sure what the _best_ really was. Money, position,\nfashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable\nthings in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed\nthem, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not\nadmirable. Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she\ncultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the\nopportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty\nnow excluded her.\n\n\"My lady,\" as\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HANNAH<|>PERSON<|>Hannah is cautious about fire safety, always having a pail of water and a dinner bell nearby)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAPHAEL<|>PERSON<|>Raphael's face was found on the under side of a moulding-board)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BACCHUS<|>PERSON<|>Bacchus was found on the head of a beer-barrel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy transitioned from fire to oil painting with enthusiasm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor, producing unique pastoral and marine views)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy was fitted out with palettes, brushes, and colors by an artist friend)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy produced monstrosities in the way of cattle and vessels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy's paintings included swarthy boys, dark-eyed Madonnas, and other figures reminiscent of famous artists)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy created charcoal portraits of the entire family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy's clay and plaster casts of acquaintances haunted corners of the house)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy attempted to cast her own foot in plaster, resulting in an accident)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo excavated Amy's foot from plaster, resulting in an injury)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHAEL ANGELO<|>PERSON<|>Michael Angelo's quote about genius being eternal patience is mentioned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy persevered in her artistic pursuits despite obstacles and failures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy desired to be an attractive and accomplished woman in addition to being a great artist)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy had a desire to move in high society and cultivated aristocratic tastes and feelings)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HANNAH<|>AMY<|>Hannah's cautiousness about fire safety influenced Amy's transition to oil painting<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAPHAEL<|>MOLDING-BOARD<|>Raphael's face was found on the under side of the moulding-board<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BACCHUS<|>BEER-BARREL<|>Bacchus was found on the head of a beer-barrel<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>ARTIST FRIEND<|>Amy was fitted out with painting supplies by an artist friend<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>PAINTINGS<|>Amy produced unique pastoral and marine views<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>CHARCOAL PORTRAITS<|>Amy created charcoal portraits of the entire family<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>CLAY AND PLASTER CASTS<|>Amy's clay and plaster casts of acquaintances haunted corners of the house<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>FOOT CASTING<|>Amy attempted to cast her own foot in plaster, resulting in an accident<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>AMY<|>Jo excavated Amy's foot from plaster, resulting in an injury<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL ANGELO<|>AMY<|>Michael Angelo's quote about genius influenced Amy's perseverance in her artistic pursuits<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>HIGH SOCIETY<|>Amy desired to move in high society and cultivated aristocratic tastes and feelings<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
