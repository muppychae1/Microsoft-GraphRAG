I think it's dreadful.\"\n\nBeing sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight\nto Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then broke\ndown, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old\ngentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach. He\nfound it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie,\nand hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo\nthat love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly, and resolved to\ncarry his boy out of harm's way; for Young Impetuosity's parting words\nto Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.\n\nWhen Laurie came home, dead tired, but quite composed, his grandfather\nmet him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very\nsuccessfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the\ntwilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the\nold man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to\nlisten to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed\nlove's labor lost. He bore it as long as he could, then went to his\npiano, and began to play. The windows were open; and Jo, walking in the\ngarden with Beth, for once understood music better than her sister, for\nhe played the \"Sonata Pathétique,\" and played it as he never did before.\n\n\"That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one cry; give\nus something gayer, lad,\" said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart was\nfull of sympathy, which he longed to show, but knew not how.\n\nLaurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several\nminutes, and would have got through bravely, if, in a momentary lull,\nMrs. March's voice had not been heard calling,--\n\n\"Jo, dear, come in; I want you.\"\n\nJust what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he\nlistened, he lost his place; the music ended with a broken chord, and\nthe musician sat silent in the dark.\n\n\"I can't stand this,\" muttered the old gentleman. Up he got, groped his\nway to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders, and\nsaid, as gently as a woman,--\n\n\"I know, my boy, I know.\"\n\nNo answer for an instant; then Laurie asked sharply,--\n\n\"Who told you?\"\n\n\"Jo herself.\"\n\n\"Then there's an end of it!\" and he shook off his grandfather's hands\nwith an impatient motion; for, though grateful for the sympathy, his\nman's pride could not bear a man's pity.\n\n\"Not quite; I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of\nit,\" returned Mr. Laurence, with unusual mildness. \"You won't care to\nstay at home just now, perhaps?\"\n\n\"I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent my seeing her,\nand I shall stay and do it as long as I like,\" interrupted Laurie, in a\ndefiant tone.\n\n\"Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, but the\ngirl can't help it; and the only thing left for you to do is to go away\nfor a time. Where will you go?\"\n\n\"Anywhere. I don't care what becomes of me;\" and Laurie got up, with a\nreckless laugh, that grated on his grandfather's ear.\n\n\"Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake. Why not\ngo abroad, as you planned, and forget it?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got\nthrough college.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!\" and Laurie walked fast through the\nroom, with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.\n\n\"I don't ask you to go alone; there's some one ready and glad to go with\nyou, anywhere in the world.\"\n\n\"Who, sir?\" stopping to listen.\n\n\"Myself.\"\n\nLaurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying\nhuskily,--\n\n\"I'm a selfish brute; but--you know--grandfather--\"\n\n\"Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all before, once\nin my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy, just\nsit quietly down, and hear my plan. It's all settled, and can be carried\nout at once,\" said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man, as if\nfearful that he would break away, as his father had done before him.\n\n\"Well, sir, what is it?\" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of interest\nin face or voice.\n\n\"There is business in London that needs looking after; I meant you\nshould attend to it; but I can do it better myself, and things here will\nget on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners do almost\neverything; I'm merely holding on till you take my place, and can be off\nat any time.\"\n\n\"But you hate travelling, sir; I can't ask it of you at your age,\" began\nLaurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go\nalone, if he went at all.\n\nThe old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to\nprevent it; for the mood\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MR.
