Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she\ncultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the\nopportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty\nnow excluded her.\n\n\"My lady,\" as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine\nlady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy\nrefinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and\nthat true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.\n\n\"I want to ask a favor of you, mamma,\" Amy said, coming in, with an\nimportant air, one day.\n\n\"Well, little girl, what is it?\" replied her mother, in whose eyes the\nstately young lady still remained \"the baby.\"\n\n\"Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate\nfor the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day. They are wild to\nsee the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things\nthey admire in my book. They have been very kind to me in many ways, and\nI am grateful, for they are all rich, and know I am poor, yet they never\nmade any difference.\"\n\n\"Why should they?\" and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls\ncalled her \"Maria Theresa air.\"\n\n\"You know as well as I that it _does_ make a difference with nearly\nevery one, so don't ruffle up, like a dear, motherly hen, when your\nchickens get pecked by smarter birds; the ugly duckling turned out a\nswan, you know;\" and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed a\nhappy temper and hopeful spirit.\n\nMrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked,--\n\n\"Well, my swan, what is your plan?\"\n\n\"I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them a\ndrive to the places they want to see, a row on the river, perhaps, and\nmake a little artistic _fÃªte_ for them.\"\n\n\"That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches,\nfruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no! we must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate and\nice-cream, besides. The girls are used to such things, and I want my\nlunch to be proper and elegant, though I _do_ work for my living.\"\n\n\"How many young ladies are there?\" asked her mother, beginning to look\nsober.\n\n\"Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come.\"\n\n\"Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them\nabout.\"\n\n\"Why, mother, how _can_ you think of such a thing? Not more than six or\neight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach-wagon, and borrow Mr.\nLaurence's cherry-bounce.\" (Hannah's pronunciation of _char-Ã -banc_.)\n\n\"All this will be expensive, Amy.\"\n\n\"Not very; I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself.\"\n\n\"Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things, and\nthe best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan would be\npleasanter to them, as a change, if nothing more, and much better for us\nthan buying or borrowing what we don't need, and attempting a style not\nin keeping with our circumstances?\"\n\n\"If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I know\nthat I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help\na little; and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it,\"\nsaid Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into\nobstinacy.\n\nMrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it\nwas possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she\nwould gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking advice\nas much as they did salts and senna.\n\n\"Very well, Amy; if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way\nthrough without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll say\nno more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you decide, I'll\ndo my best to help you.\"\n\n\"Thanks, mother; you are always _so_ kind;\" and away went Amy to lay her\nplan before her sisters.\n\nMeg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she\npossessed, from her little house itself to her very best salt-spoons.\nBut Jo frowned upon the whole project, and would have nothing to do with\nit at first.\n\n\"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and\nturn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a\nsixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle\nto any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and rides in a\n_coupÃ©_,\" said Jo, who, being called from the tragical climax of her\nnovel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.\n\n\"I _don't_ truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!\"\nreturned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions\narose. \"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a young lady who is planning a lunch and artistic event for her drawing class friends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
