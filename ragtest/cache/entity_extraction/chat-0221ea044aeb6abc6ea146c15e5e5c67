Laurie devoted himself to the little ones,\nrode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among the\nbirds' nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck. Mrs.\nMarch and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas, sorting\nthe contributions that kept pouring in; while Amy, with a beautiful\nmotherly expression in her face, sketched the various groups, and\nwatched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little crutch\nbeside him.\n\nJo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned\nup, her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her arm,\nready for any lively adventure which might turn up. Little Teddy bore a\ncharmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never felt any\nanxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on\nthe back of another, or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent\npapa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies could digest\nanything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own small\nshoes. She knew that little Ted would turn up again in time, safe and\nrosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back with a hearty\nwelcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.\n\n               [Illustration: Teddy bore a charmed life]\n\nAt four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while the\napple-pickers rested, and compared rents and bruises. Then Jo and Meg,\nwith a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the grass,\nfor an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day. The land\nliterally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for the lads\nwere not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of refreshment\nas they liked,--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul.\nThey availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for\nsome tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on\ntheir heads, others lent a charm to leap-frog by eating pie in the\npauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and\napple-turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. The\nlittle girls had a private tea-party, and Ted roved among the edibles at\nhis own sweet will.\n\nWhen no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first regular\ntoast, which was always drunk at such times,--\"Aunt March, God bless\nher!\" A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot how much\nhe owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been taught to\nkeep her memory green.\n\n\"Now, grandma's sixtieth birthday! Long life to her, with three times\nthree!\"\n\nThat was given with a will, as you may well believe; and the cheering\nonce begun, it was hard to stop it. Everybody's health was proposed,\nfrom Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the\nastonished guinea-pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search\nof its young master. Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented the\nqueen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were\ntransported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. Funny presents, some\nof them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments\nto grandma's,--for the children's gifts were all their own. Every stitch\nDaisy's patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed\nwas better than embroidery to Mrs. March; Demi's shoe-box was a miracle\nof mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut; Rob's footstool had\na wiggle in its uneven legs, that she declared was very soothing; and no\npage of the costly book Amy's child gave her was so fair as that on\nwhich appeared, in tipsy capitals, the words,--\"To dear Grandma, from\nher little Beth.\"\n\nDuring this ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared; and, when\nMrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while Teddy\nwiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to sing.\nThen, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and from tree\nto tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys sung, with all\ntheir hearts, the little song Jo had written, Laurie set to music, and\nthe Professor trained his lads to give with the best effect. This was\nsomething altogether new, and it proved a grand success; for Mrs. March\ncouldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands with every\none of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little\nquadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.\n\nAfter this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and\nher daughters under the festival tree.\n\n[Illustration: \"Leaving Mrs\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
