Lotty reported that they had eaten \"a\nmuch, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the\nsweet stuff, and hide the pots.\"\n\nMeg longed to go and tell mother; but a sense of shame at her own\nshort-comings, of loyalty to John, \"who might be cruel, but nobody\nshould know it,\" restrained her; and after a summary clearing up, she\ndressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be\nforgiven.\n\nUnfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that light. He\nhad carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little wife as\nwell as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his friend\nenjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again. But John was\nangry, though he did not show it; he felt that Meg had got him into a\nscrape, and then deserted him in his hour of need. \"It wasn't fair to\ntell a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when\nhe took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in\nthe lurch, to be laughed at or pitied. No, by George, it wasn't! and Meg\nmust know it.\" He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the\nflurry was over, and he strolled home, after seeing Scott off, a milder\nmood came over him. \"Poor little thing! it was hard upon her when she\ntried so heartily to please me. She was wrong, of course, but then she\nwas young. I must be patient and teach her.\" He hoped she had not gone\nhome--he hated gossip and interference. For a minute he was ruffled\nagain at the mere thought of it; and then the fear that Meg would cry\nherself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,\nresolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where\nshe had failed in her duty to her spouse.\n\nMeg likewise resolved to be \"calm and kind, but firm,\" and show _him_\nhis duty. She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed\nand comforted, as she was sure of being; but, of course, she did nothing\nof the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,\nas she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.\n\nJohn was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe; but, feeling\nthat his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came\nleisurely in, and laid himself upon the sofa, with the singularly\nrelevant remark,--\n\n\"We are going to have a new moon, my dear.\"\n\n\"I've no objection,\" was Meg's equally soothing remark.\n\nA few other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke,\nand wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished. John went\nto one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,\nfiguratively speaking. Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if new\nrosettes for her slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither\nspoke; both looked quite \"calm and firm,\" and both felt desperately\nuncomfortable.\n\n          [Illustration: Both felt desperately uncomfortable]\n\n\"Oh dear,\" thought Meg, \"married life is very trying, and does need\ninfinite patience, as well as love, as mother says.\" The word \"mother\"\nsuggested other maternal counsels, given long ago, and received with\nunbelieving protests.\n\n\"John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see\nand bear with them, remembering your own. He is very decided, but never\nwill be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently. He is\nvery accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait, though you\ncall him 'fussy.' Never deceive him by look or word, Meg, and he will\ngive you the confidence you deserve, the support you need. He has a\ntemper, not like ours,--one flash, and then all over,--but the white,\nstill anger, that is seldom stirred, but once kindled, is hard to\nquench. Be careful, very careful, not to wake this anger against\nyourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect. Watch\nyourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against\nthe little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave\nthe way for bitter sorrow and regret.\"\n\nThese words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,\nespecially the last. This was the first serious disagreement; her own\nhasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her\nown anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to\nsuch a scene quite melted her heart. She glanced at him with tears in\nher eyes, but he did not see them; she put down her work and got up,\nthinking, \"I _will_ be the first to say, 'Forgive me,'\" but he did not\nseem to hear her; she went very slowly across the room, for pride was\nhard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head.
