Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder,\nbut Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of\nsunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.\n\nIt wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly\nmarried, Meg cried, \"The first kiss for Marmee!\" and, turning, gave it\nwith her heart on her lips. During the next fifteen minutes she looked\nmore like a rose than ever, for every one availed themselves of their\nprivileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,\nadorned with a head-dress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her\nin the hall, crying, with a sob and a chuckle, \"Bless you, deary, a\nhundred times! The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely.\"\n\nEverybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried\nto, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are light.\nThere was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little\nhouse, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of\ncake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt March\nshrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were\nfound to be the only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes carried\nround. No one said anything, however, till Laurie, who insisted on\nserving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand\nand a puzzled expression on his face.\n\n\"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?\" he whispered, \"or am I\nmerely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this\nmorning?\"\n\n\"No; your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March\nactually sent some, but father put away a little for Beth, and\ndespatched the rest to the Soldiers' Home. You know he thinks that wine\nshould be used only in illness, and mother says that neither she nor her\ndaughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.\"\n\nMeg spoke seriously, and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh; but he\ndid neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous\nway, \"I like that! for I've seen enough harm done to wish other women\nwould think as you do.\"\n\n\"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?\" and there was an anxious\naccent in Meg's voice.\n\n\"No; I give you my word for it. Don't think too well of me, either; this\nis not one of my temptations. Being brought up where wine is as common\nas water, and almost as harmless, I don't care for it; but when a pretty\ngirl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see.\"\n\n\"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,\nLaurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest\nday of my life.\"\n\nA demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,\nfor ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if\nhe gave the promise he would keep it at all costs; and, feeling her\npower, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. She did not speak,\nbut she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness,\nand a smile which said, \"No one can refuse me anything to-day.\" Laurie\ncertainly could not; and, with an answering smile, he gave her his hand,\nsaying heartily, \"I promise, Mrs. Brooke!\"\n\n\"I thank you, very, very much.\"\n\n\"And I drink 'long life to your resolution,' Teddy,\" cried Jo, baptizing\nhim with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass, and beamed\napprovingly upon him.\n\nSo the toast was drunk, the pledge made, and loyally kept, in spite of\nmany temptations; for, with instinctive wisdom, the girls had seized a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
