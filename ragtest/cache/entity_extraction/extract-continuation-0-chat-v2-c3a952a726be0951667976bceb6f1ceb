Good-night, mother, dear. It is so\ninexpressibly comfortable to have you here,\" was Meg's quiet answer.\n\nThe kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one; and, as she went\naway, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, \"She\ndoes not love John yet, but will soon learn to.\"\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                        [Illustration: Letters]\n\n                                  XXI.\n\n               LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE.\n\n\nJo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her,\nand she found it hard not to look mysterious and important. Meg observed\nit, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had learned\nthat the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt\nsure of being told everything if she did not ask. She was rather\nsurprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed\na patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in her turn\nassumed an air of dignified reserve, and devoted herself to her mother.\nThis left Jo to her own devices; for Mrs. March had taken her place as\nnurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long\nconfinement. Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge; and, much as\nshe enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an\nincorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax her secret from her.\n\nShe was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a\nmystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of\nit. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected\nindifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he\nknew, then that he didn't care; and, at last, by dint of perseverance,\nhe satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling\nindignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his\nwits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.\n\nMeg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter, and was absorbed in\npreparations for her father's return; but all of a sudden a change\nseemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike\nherself. She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very\nquiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her face.\nTo her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and Jo's\nshe silenced by begging to be let alone.\n\n\"She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she's going very fast. She's\ngot most of the symptoms,--is twittery and cross, doesn't eat, lies\nawake, and mopes in corners. I caught her singing that song he gave her,\nand once she said 'John,' as you do, and then turned as red as a poppy.\nWhatever shall we do?\" said Jo, looking ready for any measures, however\nviolent.\n\n\"Nothing but wait. Let her alone, be kind and patient, and father's\ncoming will settle everything,\" replied her mother.\n\n\"Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy never seals\nmine,\" said Jo, next day, as she distributed the contents of the little\npost-office.\n\nMrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg\nmade them look up to see her staring at her note, with a frightened\nface.\n\n\"My child, what is it?\" cried her mother, running to her, while Jo tried\nto take the paper which had done the mischief.\n\n\"It's all a mistake--he didn't send it. O Jo, how could you do it?\" and\nMeg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart was quite broken.\n\n\"Me! I've done nothing! What's she talking about?\" cried Jo, bewildered.\n\nMeg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from\nher pocket, and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully,--\n\n\"You wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could you be so rude, so\nmean, and cruel to us both?\"\n\nJo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note, which\nwas written in a peculiar hand.\n\n        [Illustration: Jo and her mother were reading the note]\n\n    \"MY DEAREST MARGARET,--\n\n    \"I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate\n    before I return. I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think\n    they would consent if they knew that we adored one another. Mr.\n    Laurence will help me to some good place, and then, my sweet\n    girl, you will make me happy. I implore you to say nothing to\n    your family yet, but to send one word of hope through Laurie to\n                                            \"Your devoted JOHN.\"\n\n\"Oh, the little villain! that's the way he meant to pay me for keeping\nmy word to mother. I'll give him a hearty scolding, and bring him over\nto beg pardon,\" cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice. But her\nmother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore,--\n\n\"Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first.
