I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, and it\nwould be a lie to say I do when I don't.\"\n\n\"Really, truly, Jo?\"\n\nHe stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with\na look that she did not soon forget.\n\n\"Really, truly, dear.\"\n\nThey were in the grove now, close by the stile; and when the last words\nfell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as\nif to go on, but for once in his life that fence was too much for him;\nso he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still that\nJo was frightened.\n\n        [Illustration: He laid his head down on the mossy post]\n\n\"O Teddy, I'm so sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it\nwould do any good! I wish you wouldn't take it so hard. I can't help it;\nyou know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other people\nif they don't,\" cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she softly\npatted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted her so\nlong ago.\n\n\"They do sometimes,\" said a muffled voice from the post.\n\n\"I don't believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try\nit,\" was the decided answer.\n\nThere was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by\nthe river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said\nvery soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile,--\n\n\"Laurie, I want to tell you something.\"\n\nHe started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out, in\na fierce tone--\n\n\"_Don't_ tell me that, Jo; I can't bear it now!\"\n\n\"Tell what?\" she asked, wondering at his violence.\n\n\"That you love that old man.\"\n\n\"What old man?\" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.\n\n\"That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you\nlove him, I know I shall do something desperate;\" and he looked as if he\nwould keep his word, as he clenched his hands, with a wrathful spark in\nhis eyes.\n\nJo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself, and said warmly, for she,\ntoo, was getting excited with all this,--\n\n\"Don't swear, Teddy! He isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind,\nand the best friend I've got, next to you. Pray, don't fly into a\npassion; I want to be kind, but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my\nProfessor. I haven't the least idea of loving him or anybody else.\"\n\n\"But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?\"\n\n\"You'll love some one else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"I _can't_ love any one else; and I'll never forget you, Jo, never!\nnever!\" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.\n\n\"What _shall_ I do with him?\" sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more\nunmanageable than she expected. \"You haven't heard what I wanted to tell\nyou. Sit down and listen; for indeed I want to do right and make you\nhappy,\" she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which\nproved that she knew nothing about love.\n\nSeeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on\nthe grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile,\nand looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was\nnot conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part; for how\n_could_ she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes\nfull of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or\ntwo her hardness of heart had wrung from him? She gently turned his head\naway, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to\ngrow for her sake,--how touching that was, to be sure!--\n\n\"I agree with mother that you and I are not suited to each other,\nbecause our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very\nmiserable, if we were so foolish as to--\" Jo paused a little over the\nlast word, but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression,--\n\n\"Marry,--no, we shouldn't! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect\nsaint, for you could make me anything you like.\"\n\n\"No, I can't. I've tried it and failed, and I won't risk our happiness\nby such a serious experiment. We don't agree and we never shall; so\nwe'll be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything\nrash.\"\n\n\"Yes, we will if we get the chance,\" muttered Laurie rebelliously.\n\n\"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,\" implored\nJo, almost at her wit's end.\n\n\"I won't be reasonable; I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible\nview;' it won't help me, and it only makes you harder. I don't believe\nyou've got any heart.\"\n\n\"I wish I hadn't!\"\n\nThere was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and, thinking\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
