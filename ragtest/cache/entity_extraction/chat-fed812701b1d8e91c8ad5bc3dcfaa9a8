Laurie was\nsick and lonely; and, feeling how rich she was in home-love and\nhappiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very\nfriendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said,--\n\n\"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as\nmuch as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd come\nover and see us. Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of good, and\nBeth would sing to you if _I_ begged her to, and Amy would dance; Meg\nand I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we'd\nhave jolly times. Wouldn't your grandpa let you?\"\n\n\"I think he would, if your mother asked him. He's very kind, though he\ndoes not look so; and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's\nafraid I might be a bother to strangers,\" began Laurie, brightening more\nand more.\n\n\"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be\na bother. We _want_ to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever\nso long. We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got\nacquainted with all our neighbors but you.\"\n\n\"You see grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what\nhappens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know, and\nI have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get on as\nI can.\"\n\n\"That's bad. You ought to make an effort, and go visiting everywhere you\nare asked; then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go\nto. Never mind being bashful; it won't last long if you keep going.\"\n\nLaurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of\nbashfulness; for there was so much good-will in Jo, it was impossible\nnot to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.\n\n\"Do you like your school?\" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a\nlittle pause, during which he stared at the fire, and Jo looked about\nher, well pleased.\n\n\"Don't go to school; I'm a business man--girl, I mean. I go to wait on\nmy great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,\" answered Jo.\n\nLaurie opened his mouth to ask another question; but remembering just in\ntime that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's\naffairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable. Jo liked his good\nbreeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him\na lively description of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot\nthat talked Spanish, and the library where she revelled. Laurie enjoyed\nthat immensely; and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came\nonce to woo Aunt March, and, in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll\nhad tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and\nlaughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head\nin to see what was the matter.\n\n                [Illustration: Poll tweaked off his wig]\n\n\"Oh! that does me no end of good. Tell on, please,\" he said, taking his\nface out of the sofa-cushion, red and shining with merriment.\n\nMuch elated with her success, Jo did \"tell on,\" all about their plays\nand plans, their hopes and fears for father, and the most interesting\nevents of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got to\ntalking about books; and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved\nthem as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.\n\n\"If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandpa is out, so\nyou needn't be afraid,\" said Laurie, getting up.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of anything,\" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.\n\n\"I don't believe you are!\" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much\nadmiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be\na trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his\nmoods.\n\nThe atmosphere of the whole house being summer-like, Laurie led the way\nfrom room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy;\nand so at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands,\nand pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined\nwith books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little\ncabinets full of coins and curiosities, and sleepy-hollow chairs, and\nqueer tables, and bronzes; and, best of all, a great open fireplace,\nwith quaint tiles all round it.\n\n\"What richness!\" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velvet chair,\nand gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. \"Theodore\nLaurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\" she added\nimpressively.\n\n\"A fellow can't live on books,\" said Laurie, shaking his head, as he\nperched on a table opposite.\n\nBefore he could say more, a bell rung, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with\nalarm, \"Mercy me! it's your grandpa!\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
