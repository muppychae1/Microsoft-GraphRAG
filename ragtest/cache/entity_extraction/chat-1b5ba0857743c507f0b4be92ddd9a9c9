'Oh, rise!' she said, extending a hand of marble\nfairness. 'Never! till you tell me how I may rescue you,' swore the\nknight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here\ntill my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?' 'In the mauve\nsalon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 'I obey, and return\nvictorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away, and\nflinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he\nreceived--\"\n\n                  [Illustration: \"Oh, rise,\" she said]\n\n\"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a\nblack gown fired at him,\" said Ned. \"Instantly Sir What's-his-name\nrecovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to\njoin the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow; found the door\nlocked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got half-way down when\nthe ladder broke, and he went head first into the moat, sixty feet\nbelow. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to\na little door guarded by two stout fellows; knocked their heads together\ntill they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of\nhis prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone\nsteps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and\nspiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March. At the top\nof these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and\nchilled his blood--\"\n\n       [Illustration: A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon]\n\n\"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its\nwasted hand,\" went on Meg. \"It beckoned, gliding noiselessly before him\ndown a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb. Shadowy effigies in armor\nstood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and\nthe ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him, showing the\nglitter of awful eyes through its white veil. They reached a curtained\ndoor, behind which sounded lovely music; he sprang forward to enter, but\nthe spectre plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a--\"\n\n\"Snuff-box,\" said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the\naudience. \"'Thankee,' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch, and\nsneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off. 'Ha! ha!'\nlaughed the ghost; and having peeped through the key-hole at the\nprincesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her\nvictim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other\nknights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all rose\nand began to--\"\n\n                       [Illustration: He sneezed]\n\n\"Dance a hornpipe,\" cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath; \"and, as they\ndanced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail. 'Up\nwith the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard a lee, and man the\nguns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight, with a\nflag black as ink flying from her foremast. 'Go in and win, my\nhearties!' says the captain; and a tremendous fight begun. Of course the\nBritish beat; they always do.\"\n\n\"No, they don't!\" cried Jo, aside.\n\n\"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the\nschooner, whose decks were piled with dead, and whose lee-scuppers ran\nblood, for the order had been 'Cutlasses, and die hard!' 'Bosen's mate,\ntake a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if he don't\nconfess his sins double quick,' said the British captain. The Portuguese\nheld his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars\ncheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war,\nscuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, 'To the bottom of\nthe sea, sea, sea,' where--\"\n\n            [Illustration: The Portuguese walked the plank]\n\n\"Oh, gracious! what _shall_ I say?\" cried Sallie, as Fred ended his\nrigmarole, in which he had jumbled together, pell-mell, nautical phrases\nand facts, out of one of his favorite books. \"Well they went to the\nbottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on\nfinding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine,\nhoping to discover the mystery about them; for, being a woman, she was\ncurious. By and by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, 'I'll give\nyou this box of pearls if you can take it up;' for she wanted to restore\nthe poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself.
