There's one sort of poverty\nthat I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of,\nbut poor gentlefolks fare badly, because they won't ask, and people\ndon't dare to offer charity; yet there are a thousand ways of helping\nthem, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not\noffend. I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a\nblarneying beggar; I suppose it's wrong, but I do, though it is\nharder.\"\n\n\"Because it takes a gentleman to do it,\" added the other member of the\ndomestic admiration society.\n\n\"Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment. But I was\ngoing to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good many\ntalented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and enduring real\nhardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid fellows, some\nof them, working like heroes, poor and friendless, but so full of\ncourage, patience, and ambition, that I was ashamed of myself, and\nlonged to give them a right good lift. Those are people whom it's a\nsatisfaction to help, for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be\nallowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of\nfuel to keep the pot boiling; if they haven't, it's a pleasure to\ncomfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it\nout.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; and there's another class who can't ask, and who suffer in\nsilence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you made a\nprincess of me, as the king does the beggar-maid in the old story.\nAmbitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see youth,\nhealth, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a little help\nat the right minute. People have been very kind to me; and whenever I\nsee girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put out my hand\nand help them, as I was helped.\"\n\n\"And so you shall, like an angel as you are!\" cried Laurie, resolving,\nwith a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution for\nthe express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies. \"Rich\npeople have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their\nmoney accumulate for others to waste. It's not half so sensible to leave\nlegacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive, and\nenjoy making one's fellow-creatures happy with it. We'll have a good\ntime ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving\nother people a generous taste. Will you be a little Dorcas, going about\nemptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with good deeds?\"\n\n\"With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin, stopping, as you\nride gallantly through the world, to share your cloak with the beggar.\"\n\n\"It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!\"\n\nSo the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again,\nfeeling that their pleasant home was more home-like because they hoped\nto brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more\nuprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough\nways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely\nknit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest\nthan they.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                                  XLV.\n\n                            DAISY AND DEMI.\n\n\nI cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March\nfamily, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious\nand important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of\ndiscretion; for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their\nrights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their elders do.\nIf there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoilt by\nadoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most\nremarkable children ever born, as will be shown when I mention that they\nwalked at eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two\nyears they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety\nwhich charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy demanded a \"needler,\" and\nactually made a bag with four stitches in it; she likewise set up\nhousekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking-stove\nwith a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's eyes, while Demi\nlearned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a new mode of\nteaching the alphabet by forming the letters with his arms and legs,\nthus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy early developed a\nmechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother,\nfor he tried to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a\nchaotic condition, with his \"sewin-sheen,\"--a mysterious structure of\nstring, chairs, clothes-pins, and spools, for wheels to go \"wound and\nwound;\" also a basket hung over the back of a big chair, in which he\nvainly tried to hoist his too\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VERDANTIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Verdantis is a country with a Central Institution that sets interest rates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Central Institution is the Federal Reserve of Verdantis, which is setting interest rates on Monday and Thursday)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Martin Smith is the chair of the Central Institution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET STRATEGY COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Central Institution committee makes key decisions about interest rates and the growth of Verdantis's money supply)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>Martin Smith is the Chair of the Central Institution and will answer questions at a press conference<|>9)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TECHGLOBAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TechGlobal is a stock now listed on the Global Exchange which powers 85% of premium smartphones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VISION HOLDINGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vision Holdings is a firm that previously owned TechGlobal)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TECHGLOBAL<|>VISION HOLDINGS<|>Vision Holdings formerly owned TechGlobal from 2014 until present<|>5)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Firuzabad held Aurelians as hostages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>Country seeking to release hostages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Country that negotiated a swap of money in exchange for hostages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIRUZIA<|>GEO<|>Capital of Firuzabad where the Aurelians were being held)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KROHAARA<|>GEO<|>Capital city in Quintara)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASHION<|>GEO<|>Capital city in Aurelia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Aurelian who spent time in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Prison in Tiruzia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Aurelian journalist who was held hostage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Bratinas national and environmentalist who was held hostage)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>AURELIA<|>Firuzabad negotiated a hostage exchange with Aurelia<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUINTARA<|>AURELIA<|>Quintara brokered the hostage exchange between Firuzabad and Aurelia<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUINTARA<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Quintara brokered the hostage exchange between Firuzabad and Aurelia<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>Samuel Namara was a prisoner at Alhamia prison<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>Samuel Namara and Meggie Tazbah were exchanged in the same hostage release<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>Samuel Namara and Durke Bataglani were exchanged in the same hostage release<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>Meggie Tazbah and Durke Bataglani were exchanged in the same hostage release<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Samuel Namara was a hostage in Firuzabad<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Meggie Tazbah was a hostage in Firuzabad<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Durke Bataglani was a hostage in Firuzabad<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
