Wonder how old he is?\"\n\nIt was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask; but she checked herself in\ntime, and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a roundabout way.\n\n\"I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your\nbooks,--no, I mean studying hard\"; and Jo blushed at the dreadful\n\"pegging\" which had escaped her.\n\nLaurie smiled, but didn't seem shocked, and answered, with a shrug,--\n\n\"Not for a year or two; I won't go before seventeen, anyway.\"\n\n\"Aren't you but fifteen?\" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she\nhad imagined seventeen already.\n\n\"Sixteen, next month.\"\n\n\"How I wish I was going to college! You don't look as if you liked it.\"\n\n\"I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don't like the way\nfellows do either, in this country.\"\n\n\"What do you like?\"\n\n\"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.\"\n\nJo wanted very much to ask what his own way was; but his black brows\nlooked rather threatening as he knit them; so she changed the subject by\nsaying, as her foot kept time, \"That's a splendid polka! Why don't you\ngo and try it?\"\n\n\"If you will come too,\" he answered, with a gallant little bow.\n\n\"I can't; for I told Meg I wouldn't, because--\" There Jo stopped, and\nlooked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.\n\n\"Because what?\" asked Laurie curiously.\n\n\"You won't tell?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my\nfrocks, and I scorched this one; and, though it's nicely mended, it\nshows, and Meg told me to keep still, so no one would see it. You may\nlaugh, if you want to; it is funny, I know.\"\n\nBut Laurie didn't laugh; he only looked down a minute, and the\nexpression of his face puzzled Jo, when he said very gently,--\n\n\"Never mind that; I'll tell you how we can manage: there's a long hall\nout there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please\ncome?\"\n\nJo thanked him, and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves, when\nshe saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The hall was\nempty, and they had a grand polka; for Laurie danced well, and taught\nher the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring.\nWhen the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath;\nand Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students' festival at\nHeidelberg, when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and\nJo reluctantly followed her into a side-room, where she found her on a\nsofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.\n\n              [Illustration: They sat down on the stairs]\n\n\"I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned, and gave me a sad\nwrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm ever\ngoing to get home,\" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\n\n\"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry. But I\ndon't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all\nnight,\" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.\n\n\"I can't have a carriage, without its costing ever so much. I dare say I\ncan't get one at all; for most people come in their own, and it's a long\nway to the stable, and no one to send.\"\n\n\"I'll go.\"\n\n\"No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop here, for\nthe house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll rest\ntill Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\"\n\n\"I'll ask Laurie; he will go,\" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea\noccurred to her.\n\n\"Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell any one. Get me my rubbers, and put these\nslippers with our things. I can't dance any more; but as soon as supper\nis over, watch for Hannah, and tell me the minute she comes.\"\n\n\"They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you; I'd rather.\"\n\n\"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired, I can't\nstir!\"\n\nSo Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away\nto the dining-room, which she found after going into a china-closet, and\nopening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little\nprivate refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee,\nwhich she immediately spilt, thereby making the front of her dress as\nbad as the back.\n\n\"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's glove\nby scrubbing her gown with it.\n\n\"Can I help you?\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
