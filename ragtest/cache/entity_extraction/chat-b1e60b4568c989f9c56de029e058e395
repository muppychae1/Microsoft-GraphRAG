Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don't\nbelieve in Spiritualism, and copied my characters from life, I don't see\nhow this critic _can_ be right. Another says, 'It's one of the best\nAmerican novels which has appeared for years' (I know better than that);\nand the next asserts that 'though it is original, and written with great\nforce and feeling, it is a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't! Some make fun of\nit, some over-praise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to\nexpound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the money.

John should find home a\nparadise; he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously\nevery day, and never know the loss of a button. She brought so much\nlove, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but\nsucceed, in spite of some obstacles. Her paradise was not a tranquil\none; for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and\nbustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares. She was too\ntired, sometimes, even to smile; John grew dyspeptic after a course of\ndainty dishes, and ungratefully demanded plain fare. As for buttons, she\nsoon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the\ncarelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,\nand then see if _his_ work would stand impatient tugs and clumsy fingers\nany better than hers.\n\nThey were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn't live\non love alone. John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though she\nbeamed at him from behind the familiar coffee-pot; nor did Meg miss any\nof the romance from the daily parting, when her husband followed up his\nkiss with the tender inquiry, \"Shall I send home veal or mutton for\ndinner, darling?\" The little house ceased to be a glorified bower, but\nit became a home, and the young couple soon felt that it was a change\nfor the better. At first they played keep-house, and frolicked over it\nlike children; then John took steadily to business, feeling the cares of\nthe head of a family upon his shoulders; and Meg laid by her cambric\nwrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to work, as before said, with\nmore energy than discretion.\n\nWhile the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's Receipt\nBook as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the problems\nwith patience and care. Sometimes her family were invited in to help eat\nup a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be privately\ndespatched with a batch of failures, which were to be concealed from all\neyes in the convenient stomachs of the little Hummels. An evening with\nJohn over the account-books usually produced a temporary lull in the\nculinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would ensue, during which the poor\nman was put through a course of bread-pudding, hash, and warmed-over\ncoffee, which tried his soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy\nfortitude. Before the golden mean was found, however, Meg added to her\ndomestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without,--a\nfamily jar.\n\nFired with a housewifely wish to see her store-room stocked with\nhome-made preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John\nwas requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots, and an extra\nquantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe, and were to be\nattended to at once. As John firmly believed that \"my wife\" was equal to\nanything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that she\nshould be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
