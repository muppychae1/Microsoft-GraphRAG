The more you love and trust Him, the\nnearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power\nand wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken\nfrom you, but may become the source of life-long peace, happiness, and\nstrength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little\ncares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as\nyou come to your mother.\"\n\nJo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and, in the silence which\nfollowed, the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart\nwithout words; for in that sad, yet happy hour, she had learned not only\nthe bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial\nand self-control; and, led by her mother's hand, she had drawn nearer to\nthe Friend who welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of\nany father, tenderer than that of any mother.\n\nAmy stirred, and sighed in her sleep; and, as if eager to begin at once\nto mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it\nhad never worn before.\n\n\"I let the sun go down on my anger; I wouldn't forgive her, and to-day,\nif it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too late! How could I\nbe so wicked?\" said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister,\nsoftly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.\n\nAs if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a\nsmile that went straight to Jo's heart. Neither said a word, but they\nhugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was\nforgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.\n\n\n\n\n              [Illustration: Packing the go abroady trunk]\n\n                                  IX.\n\n                        MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR.\n\n\n\"I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those\nchildren should have the measles just now,\" said Meg, one April day, as\nshe stood packing the \"go abroady\" trunk in her room, surrounded by her\nsisters.\n\n\"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole\nfortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,\" replied Jo, looking like a\nwindmill, as she folded skirts with her long arms.\n\n\"And such lovely weather; I'm so glad of that,\" added Beth, tidily\nsorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great\noccasion.\n\n\"I wish I was going to have a fine time, and wear all these nice\nthings,\" said Amy, with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically\nreplenished her sister's cushion.\n\n\"I wish you were all going; but, as you can't, I shall keep my\nadventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's the least I can\ndo, when you have been so kind, lending me things, and helping me get\nready,\" said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,\nwhich seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.\n\n\"What did mother give you out of the treasure-box?\" asked Amy, who had\nnot been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest, in which Mrs.\nMarch kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when\nthe proper time came.\n\n\"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue\nsash. I wanted the violet silk; but there isn't time to make it over, so\nI must be contented with my old tarlatan.\"\n\n\"It will look nicely over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it\noff beautifully. I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you\nmight have had it,\" said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose\npossessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.\n\n\"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure-box; but\nmother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,\nand Laurie promised to send me all I want,\" replied Meg. \"Now, let me\nsee; there's my new gray walking-suit--just curl up the feather in my\nhat, Beth,--then my poplin, for Sunday, and the small party,--it looks\nheavy for spring, doesn't it? The violet silk would be so nice; oh,\ndear!\"\n\n\"Never mind; you've got the tarlatan for the big party, and you always\nlook like an angel in white,\" said Amy, brooding over the little store\nof finery in which her soul delighted.\n\n\"It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to\ndo. My blue house-dress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that\nI feel as if I'd got a new one.
