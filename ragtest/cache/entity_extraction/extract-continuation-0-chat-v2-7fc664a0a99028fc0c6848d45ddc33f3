I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing; that will be\nbetter than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as\nthey are,\" said Meg.\n\n\"I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music\nand dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not playing,\"\nwas Beth's resolution; while Amy followed their example by heroically\ndeclaring, \"I shall learn to make button-holes, and attend to my parts\nof speech.\"\n\n\"Very good! then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy\nthat we shall not have to repeat it; only don't go to the other extreme,\nand delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work and play; make each\nday both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of\ntime by employing it well.

One July day she came in with her hands full,\nand went about the house leaving letters and parcels, like the penny\npost.\n\n\"Here's your posy, mother! Laurie never forgets that,\" she said, putting\nthe fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in \"Marmee's corner,\" and was\nkept supplied by the affectionate boy.\n\n\"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\" continued Beth, delivering the\narticles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.\n\n\"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\" said Meg, looking\nat the gray cotton glove.\n\n\"Didn't you drop the other in the garden?\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure I didn't; for there was only one in the office.\"\n\n\"I hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found. My\nletter is only a translation of the German song I wanted; I think Mr.\nBrooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing.\"\n\nMrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham\nmorning-gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and very\nwomanly, as she sat sewing at her little work-table, full of tidy white\nrolls; so unconscious of the thought in her mother's mind as she sewed\nand sung, while her fingers flew, and her thoughts were busied with\ngirlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that\nMrs. March smiled, and was satisfied.\n\n\"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered\nthe whole post-office, stuck outside,\" said Beth, laughing, as she went\ninto the study, where Jo sat writing.\n\n\"What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the\nfashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, 'Why mind the\nfashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I would if I had\none, and he has sent me this, to try me. I'll wear it, for fun, and show\nhim I _don't_ care for the fashion;\" and, hanging the antique broad-brim\non a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.\n\nOne from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said\nto her,--\n\n    \"MY DEAR:\n\n    \"I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I\n    watch your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about\n    your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no\n    one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may\n    trust the well-worn cover of your guide-book. _I_, too, have\n    seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your\n    resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear,\n    patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one\n    sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving\n\n                                                           \"MOTHER.\"\n\n\"That does me good! that's worth millions of money and pecks of praise.\nO Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get tired, since I\nhave you to help me.\"\n\nLaying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy\ntears, for she _had_ thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts\nto be good; and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,\nbecause unexpected, and from the person whose commendation she most\nvalued. Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she\npinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she\nbe taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready\nfor either good or bad news.
