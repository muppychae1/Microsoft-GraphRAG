Come to your tea,\nsir, and behave like a gentleman;\" and having pulled the boy's hair by\nway of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a\nseries of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an\nexplosion of laughter from Jo.\n\nThe old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but\nhe watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and\nthe change in his grandson did not escape him. There was color, light,\nand life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine\nmerriment in his laugh.\n\n\"She's right; the lad _is_ lonely. I'll see what these little girls can\ndo for him,\" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked\nJo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him; and she seemed to understand the\nboy almost as well as if she had been one herself.\n\nIf the Laurences had been what Jo called \"prim and poky,\" she would not\nhave got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward; but\nfinding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good\nimpression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had\nsomething more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which\nhad been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as\nshe went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either\nside, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and\ntrees that hung above her,--while her new friend cut the finest flowers\ntill his hands were full; then he tied them up, saying, with the happy\nlook Jo liked to see, \"Please give these to your mother, and tell her I\nlike the medicine she sent me very much.\"\n\n            [Illustration: Please give these to your mother]\n\nThey found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great\ndrawing-room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano,\nwhich stood open.\n\n\"Do you play?\" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful\nexpression.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he answered modestly.\n\n\"Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.\"\n\n\"Won't you first?\"\n\n\"Don't know how; too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.\"\n\nSo Laurie played, and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in\nheliotrope and tea-roses. Her respect and regard for the \"Laurence boy\"\nincreased very much, for he played remarkably well, and didn't put on\nany airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so; only\npraised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to the\nrescue. \"That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugar-plums\nare not good for him. His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well\nin more important things. Going? Well, I'm much obliged to you, and I\nhope you'll come again. My respects to your mother. Good-night, Doctor\nJo.\"\n\nHe shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.\nWhen they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said anything\namiss. He shook his head.\n\n\"No, it was me; he doesn't like to hear me play.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can't.\"\n\n\"No need of that; I am not a young lady, and it's only a step. Take care\nof yourself, won't you?\"\n\n\"Yes; but you will come again, I hope?\"\n\n\"If you promise to come and see us after you are well.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Laurie!\"\n\n\"Good-night, Jo, good-night!\"\n\nWhen all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt\ninclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very\nattractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March\nwanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him;\nMeg longed to walk in the conservatory; Beth sighed for the grand piano;\nand Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.\n\n\"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?\" asked Jo,\nwho was of an inquiring disposition.\n\n\"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father,\nmarried an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who\nis very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did\nnot like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died\nwhen Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home.\nI fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old\nman is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes\nnaturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare\nsay his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician; at any\nrate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he\n'glowered,' as Jo said.\"\n\n\"Dear me\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a young woman who is friends with Laurie and Mr. Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURENCE<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Laurence is an old gentleman who is the grandfather of Laurie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a young man who plays the piano and is friends with Jo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is someone Jo wants to hear Laurie play the piano for)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
