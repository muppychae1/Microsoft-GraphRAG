By and by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, 'I'll give\nyou this box of pearls if you can take it up;' for she wanted to restore\nthe poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself. So\nthe diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed, on opening it, to\nfind no pearls. He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found\nby a--\"\n\n\"Little goose-girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,\" said\nAmy, when Sallie's invention gave out. \"The little girl was sorry for\nthem, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them. 'Your\ngeese will tell you, they know everything,' said the old woman. So she\nasked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,\nand all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed--\"\n\n\"'Cabbages!'\" continued Laurie promptly. \"'Just the thing,' said the\ngirl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,\nthe knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way\nrejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other\nheads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The\nknight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and\nlearned that the princesses had spun themselves free, and all gone to be\nmarried, but one. He was in a great state of mind at that; and mounting\nthe colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle\nto see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his\naffections picking flowers in her garden. 'Will you give me a rose?'\nsaid he. 'You must come and get it. I can't come to you; it isn't\nproper,' said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge,\nbut it seemed to grow higher and higher; then he tried to push through,\nbut it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently\nbroke twig after twig, till he had made a little hole, through which he\npeeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in! let me in!'
