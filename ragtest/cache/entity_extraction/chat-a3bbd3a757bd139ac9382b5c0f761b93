Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and\nsemi-occasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed\nafterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had\nhard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting\nher into trouble; her anger never lasted long, and, having humbly\nconfessed her fault, she sincerely repented, and tried to do better. Her\nsisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury,\nbecause she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately to be\ngood, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her;\nand it took years of patient effort to subdue it.\n\nWhen they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed an\ninjured air as they came in; never lifted her eyes from her book, or\nasked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered\nresentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire, and receive a glowing\ndescription of the play. On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's\nfirst look was toward the bureau; for, in their last quarrel, Amy had\nsoothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the\nfloor. Everything was in its place, however; and after a hasty glance\ninto her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had\nforgiven and forgotten her wrongs.\n\nThere Jo was mistaken; for next day she made a discovery which produced\na tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the\nafternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited, and demanding\nbreathlessly, \"Has any one taken my book?\"\n\nMeg and Beth said \"No,\" at once, and looked surprised; Amy poked the\nfire, and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise, and was down upon her in\na minute.\n\n\"Amy, you've got it?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't.\"\n\n\"You know where it is, then?\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"That's a fib!\" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking\nfierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.\n\n\"It isn't. I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and don't\ncare.\"\n\n\"You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or I'll\nmake you,\" and Jo gave her a slight shake.\n\n\"Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book again,\"\ncried Amy, getting excited in her turn.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I burnt it up.\"\n\n                     [Illustration: I burnt it up]\n\n\"What! my little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to\nfinish before father got home? Have you really burnt it?\" said Jo,\nturning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy\nnervously.\n\n\"Yes, I did! I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross yesterday,\nand I have, so--\"\n\nAmy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy\ntill her teeth chattered in her head; crying, in a passion of grief and\nanger,--\n\n\"You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I'll never\nforgive you as long as I live.\"\n\nMeg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside\nherself; and, with a parting box on her sister's ear, she rushed out of\nthe room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.\n\nThe storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard\nthe story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her\nsister. Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her\nfamily as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen\nlittle fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her\nwhole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to\nprint. She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the\nold manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work of\nseveral years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a\ndreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.\nBeth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her\npet; Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would\nlove her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted\nmore than any of them.\n\nWhen the tea-bell rung, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable\nthat it took all Amy's courage to say meekly,--\n\n\"Please forgive me, Jo; I'm very, very sorry.\"\n\n\"I never shall forgive you,\" was Jo's stern answer; and, from that\nmoment, she ignored Amy entirely.\n\nNo one spoke of the great trouble,--not even Mrs. March,--for all had\nlearned by\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
