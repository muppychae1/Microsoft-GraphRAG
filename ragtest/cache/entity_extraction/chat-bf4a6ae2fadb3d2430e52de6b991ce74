I couldn't help hearing, at\nfirst, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't remember that I\nought to go away.\"\n\n\"Just wait till _I_ see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to settle\nsuch ridiculous stuff. The idea of having 'plans,' and being kind to\nLaurie, because he's rich, and may marry us by and by! Won't he shout,\nwhen I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?\" and\nJo laughed, as if, on second thoughts, the thing struck her as a good\njoke.\n\n\"If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you! She mustn't, must she,\nmother?\" said Meg, looking distressed.\n\n\"No; never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you\ncan,\" said Mrs. March gravely. \"I was very unwise to let you go among\npeople of whom I know so little,--kind, I dare say, but worldly,\nill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more\nsorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,\nMeg.\"\n\n\"Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me; I'll forget all the bad, and\nremember only the good; for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very\nmuch for letting me go. I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied, mother;\nI know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay with you till I'm fit to\ntake care of myself. But it _is_ nice to be praised and admired, and I\ncan't help saying I like it,\" said Meg, looking half ashamed of the\nconfession.\n\n\"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not\nbecome a passion, and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things. Learn\nto know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the\nadmiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, Meg.\"\n\nMargaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind\nher, looking both interested and a little perplexed; for it was a new\nthing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and\nthings of that sort; and Jo felt as if, during that fortnight, her\nsister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a\nworld where she could not follow.\n\n\"Mother, do you have 'plans,' as Mrs. Moffat said?\" asked Meg bashfully.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I have a great many; all mothers do, but mine differ\nsomewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect. I will tell you some of them,\nfor the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and\nheart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg, but\nnot too young to understand me; and mothers' lips are the fittest to\nspeak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come in time,\nperhaps, so listen to my 'plans,' and help me carry them out, if they\nare good.\"\n\nJo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they\nwere about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,\nand watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her\nserious yet cheery way,--\n\n      [Illustration: Holding a hand of each, Mrs. March said, &c.]\n\n\"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good; to be\nadmired, loved, and respected; to have a happy youth, to be well and\nwisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care\nand sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen\nby a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a\nwoman; and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience.\nIt is natural to think of it, Meg; right to hope and wait for it, and\nwise to prepare for it; so that, when the happy time comes, you may\nfeel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. My dear girls, I _am_\nambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the world,--marry\nrich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid houses, which\nare not homes because love is wanting. Money is a needful and precious\nthing,--and, when well used, a noble thing,--but I never want you to\nthink it is the first or only prize to strive for. I'd rather see you\npoor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on\nthrones, without self-respect and peace\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
