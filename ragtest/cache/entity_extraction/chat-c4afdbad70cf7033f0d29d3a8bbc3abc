For a\nminute she felt as if she really couldn't do it; then came the thought,\n\"This is the beginning, I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach\nmyself with,\" and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the\nforehead. Of course that settled it; the penitent kiss was better than a\nworld of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying\ntenderly,--\n\n\"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly-pots. Forgive me,\ndear, I never will again!\"\n\nBut he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both\ndeclaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made; for family\npeace was preserved in that little family jar.\n\nAfter this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and\nserved him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first\ncourse; on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made\neverything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a happy\nfellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the\nway home.\n\nIn the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg. Sallie Moffat\nrenewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at\nthe little house, or inviting \"that poor dear\" to come in and spend the\nday at the big house. It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often\nfelt lonely; all were busy at home, John absent till night, and nothing\nto do but sew, or read, or potter about. So it naturally fell out that\nMeg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend. Seeing\nSallie's pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself because\nshe had not got them. Sallie was very kind, and often offered her the\ncoveted trifles; but Meg declined them, knowing that John wouldn't like\nit; and then this foolish little woman went and did what John disliked\ninfinitely worse.\n\nShe knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted\nher, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value\nmore,--his money. She knew where it was, was free to take what she\nliked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny,\npay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's wife.\nTill now, she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her little\naccount-books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without fear. But\nthat autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted her, like\nmany a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress. Meg didn't like to\nbe pitied and made to feel poor; it irritated her, but she was ashamed\nto confess it, and now and then she tried to console herself by buying\nsomething pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she had to economize. She\nalways felt wicked after it, for the pretty things were seldom\nnecessaries; but then they cost so little, it wasn't worth worrying\nabout; so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in the shopping\nexcursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.\n\nBut the trifles cost more than one would imagine; and when she cast up\nher accounts at the end of the month, the sum total rather scared her.\nJohn was busy that month, and left the bills to her; the next month he\nwas absent; but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg\nnever forgot it. A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and it\nweighed upon her conscience. Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg\nlonged for a new one,--just a handsome light one for parties, her black\nsilk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper\nfor girls. Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of twenty-five\ndollars apiece at New Year; that was only a month to wait, and here was\na lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had the money, if she\nonly dared to take it. John always said what was his was hers; but would\nhe think it right to spend not only the prospective five-and-twenty, but\nanother five-and-twenty out of the household fund? That was the\nquestion. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to loan the money,\nand with the best intentions in life, had tempted Meg beyond her\nstrength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely, shimmering\nfolds, and said, \"A bargain, I assure you, ma'am.\" She answered, \"I'll\ntake it;\" and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie had exulted, and\nshe had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence, and driven\naway, feeling as if she had stolen something, and the police were after\nher.\n\n             [Illustration: A bargain, I assure you, ma'am]\n\nWhen she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by\nspreading forth\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
