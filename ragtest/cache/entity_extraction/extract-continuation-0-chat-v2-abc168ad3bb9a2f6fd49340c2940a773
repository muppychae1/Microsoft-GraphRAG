Excuse me for a moment; we are just finishing\nour lesson. Now, Demi, make the letter and tell its name.\"\n\n\"I knows him!\" and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took\nthe shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil triumphantly\nshouted, \"It's a We, dranpa, it's a We!\"\n\n                   [Illustration: Dranpa, it's a We]\n\n\"He's a born Weller,\" laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself up, and\nher nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only mode of expressing\nhis satisfaction that school was over.\n\n\"What have you been at to-day, b√ºbchen?\" asked Mr. Bhaer, picking up the\ngymnast.\n\n\"Me went to see little Mary.\"\n\n\"And what did you there?\"\n\n\"I kissed her,\" began Demi, with artless frankness.\n\n\"Prut! thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to that?\"\nasked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon\nhis knee, exploring the waistcoat-pocket.\n\n\"Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. _Don't_ little\nboys like little girls?\" added Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of\nbland satisfaction.\n\n\"You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?\" said Jo, enjoying\nthe innocent revelations as much as the Professor.\n\n\"'Tisn't in mine head; it's in mine mouf,\" answered literal Demi,\nputting out his tongue, with a chocolate-drop on it, thinking she\nalluded to confectionery, not ideas.\n\n\"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend: sweets to the sweet,\nmannling;\" and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her\nwonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi also saw\nthe smile, was impressed by it, and artlessly inquired,--\n\n\"Do great boys like great girls, too, 'Fessor?\"\n\nLike young Washington, Mr. Bhaer \"couldn't tell a lie;\" so he gave the\nsomewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone that\nmade Mr. March put down his clothes-brush, glance at Jo's retiring face,\nand then sink into his chair, looking as if the \"precocious chick\" had\nput an idea into _his_ head that was both sweet and sour.\n\nWhy Dodo, when she caught him in the china-closet half an hour\nafterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a\ntender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she\nfollowed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice\nof bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi puzzled\nhis small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n       [Illustration: Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades]\n\n                                 XLVI.\n\n                          UNDER THE UMBRELLA.\n\n\nWhile Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets,\nas they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, Mr.\nBhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy\nroads and sodden fields.\n\n\"I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know why I should\ngive it up, just because I often happen to meet the Professor on his way\nout,\" said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters; for, though\nthere were two paths to Meg's, whichever one she took she was sure to\nmeet him, either going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and\nnever seemed to see her till quite close, when he would look as if his\nshort-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till\nthat moment. Then, if she was going to Meg's, he always had something\nfor the babies; if her face was turned homeward, he had merely strolled\ndown to see the river, and was just about returning, unless they were\ntired of his frequent calls.\n\nUnder the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and\ninvite him in? If she _was_ tired of his visits, she concealed her\nweariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee\nfor supper, \"as Friedrich--I mean Mr. Bhaer--doesn't like tea.\"\n\nBy the second week, every one knew perfectly well what was going on, yet\nevery one tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in\nJo's face. They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her hair\nthree times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise; and no\none seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while\ntalking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter lessons in\nlove.\n\nJo couldn't even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried\nto quench her feelings; and, failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated\nlife. She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering,\nafter her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was her\nespecial dread; but, thanks to the new manager, he behaved with\npraiseworthy propriety,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR BHAER<|>PERSON<|>Professor Bhaer is a preceptor who teaches lessons and interacts with Jo and Demi)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEMI<|>PERSON<|>Demi is a young pupil who attends lessons with Professor Bhaer and Jo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character who interacts with Professor Bhaer and Demi, showing signs of affection and blooming with evening exercise)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
