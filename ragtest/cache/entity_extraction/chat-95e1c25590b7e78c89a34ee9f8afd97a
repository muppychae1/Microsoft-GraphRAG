John\nwas requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots, and an extra\nquantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe, and were to be\nattended to at once. As John firmly believed that \"my wife\" was equal to\nanything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that she\nshould be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most\npleasing form for winter use. Home came four dozen delightful little\npots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for\nher. With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the\nelbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the\nbib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her\nsuccess; for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array\nof pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and\nthe nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg\nresolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,\nstraining, and fussing over her jelly. She did her best; she asked\nadvice of Mrs. Cornelius; she racked her brain to remember what Hannah\ndid that she had left undone; she reboiled, resugared, and restrained,\nbut that dreadful stuff wouldn't \"_jell_.\"\n\nShe longed to run home, bib and all, and ask mother to lend a hand, but\nJohn and she had agreed that they would never annoy any one with their\nprivate worries, experiments, or quarrels. They had laughed over that\nlast word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one; but\nthey had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on without\nhelp they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had advised the\nplan. So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot\nsummer day, and at five o'clock sat down in her topsy-turvy kitchen,\nwrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and wept.\n\nNow, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said,--\n\n\"My husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he\nlikes. I shall always be prepared; there shall be no flurry, no\nscolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good\ndinner. John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you please,\nand be sure of a welcome from me.\"\n\nHow charming that was, to be sure! John quite glowed with pride to hear\nher say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior\nwife. But, although they had had company from time to time, it never\nhappened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an opportunity to\ndistinguish herself till now. It always happens so in this vale of\ntears; there is an inevitability about such things which we can only\nwonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.\n\nIf John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have been\nunpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the year, to\nbring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly. Congratulating himself that\na handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling sure that it\nwould be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant anticipations of\nthe charming effect it would produce, when his pretty wife came running\nout to meet him, he escorted his friend to his mansion, with the\nirrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband.\n\nIt is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached the\nDove-cote. The front door usually stood hospitably open; now it was not\nonly shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still adorned the steps. The\nparlor-windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty wife\nsewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in her\nhair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her\nguest. Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared, but a\nsanguinary-looking boy asleep under the currant-bushes.\n\n\"I'm afraid something has happened. Step into the garden, Scott, while I\nlook up Mrs. Brooke,\" said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.\n\nRound the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burnt sugar, and\nMr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face. He paused\ndiscreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared; but he could both see\nand hear, and, being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.\n\nIn the kitchen reigned confusion and despair; one edition of jelly was\ntrickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was\nburning gayly on the stove. Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly\neating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly\nliquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat\nsobbing dismally.\n\n\"My dearest girl, what is the matter?\" cried John, rushing in, with\nawful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret\nconsternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.\n\n\"O John, I _\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
