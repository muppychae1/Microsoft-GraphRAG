You should do just what your grandfather wishes,\nmy dear boy,\" said Meg, in her most maternal tone. \"Do your best at\ncollege, and, when he sees that you try to please him, I'm sure he won't\nbe hard or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one else to stay with\nand love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you left him without\nhis permission. Don't be dismal or fret, but do your duty; and you'll\nget your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved.\"\n\n\"What do you know about him?\" asked Laurie, grateful for the good\nadvice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation\nfrom himself, after his unusual outbreak.\n\n\"Only what your grandpa told us about him,--how he took good care of his\nown mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice\nperson, because he wouldn't leave her; and how he provides now for an\nold woman who nursed his mother; and never tells any one, but is just as\ngenerous and patient and good as he can be.\"\n\n\"So he is, dear old fellow!\" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,\nlooking flushed and earnest with her story. \"It's like grandpa to find\nout all about him, without letting him know, and to tell all his\ngoodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn't\nunderstand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me,\nand treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He thought she was just\nperfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you\nall in flaming style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll do for\nBrooke.\"\n\n\"Begin to do something now, by not plaguing his life out,\" said Meg\nsharply.\n\n\"How do you know I do, miss?\"\n\n\"I can always tell by his face, when he goes away. If you have been\ngood, he looks satisfied and walks briskly; if you have plagued him,\nhe's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Well, I like that! So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in\nBrooke's face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he passes your window,\nbut I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph.\"\n\n                [Illustration: I see him bow and smile]\n\n\"We haven't; don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said anything! It\nwas only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here is\nsaid in confidence, you know,\" cried Meg, much alarmed at the thought of\nwhat might follow from her careless speech.\n\n\"_I_ don't tell tales,\" replied Laurie, with his \"high and mighty\" air,\nas Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. \"Only if\nBrooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather\nfor him to report.\"\n\n\"Please don't be offended. I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be\nsilly; I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd be\nsorry for, by and by. You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were our\nbrother, and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.\" And\nMeg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.\n\nAshamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,\nand said frankly, \"I'm the one to be forgiven; I'm cross, and have been\nout of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my faults and be\nsisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes; I thank you all the\nsame.\"\n\nBent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable\nas possible,--wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook\ndown cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a\nfit person to belong to the \"Busy Bee Society.\" In the midst of an\nanimated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those\namiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound of\na bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea \"to draw,\" and they would\njust have time to get home to supper.\n\n\"May I come again?\" asked Laurie.\n\n\"Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer are\ntold to do,\" said Meg smiling.\n\n\"I'll try.\"\n\n\"Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do;\nthere's a demand for socks just now,\" added Jo, waving hers, like a big\nblue worsted banner, as they parted at the gate.\n\nThat night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie,\nstanding in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David,\nwhose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old\nman, who sat with his gray head on his\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TEDDY<|>PERSON<|>Teddy is a character mentioned in the text who is advised to try the world for himself)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character in the text who advises Teddy to sail away and try his own way)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character in the text who receives advice from Jo and Meg)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a character in the text who gives advice to Laurie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
