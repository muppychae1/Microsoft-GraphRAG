but when, after\nstanding a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he\nanswered, in a tone of calm conviction, \"In my little belly,\" the old\ngentleman could only join in grandma's laugh, and dismiss the class in\nmetaphysics.\n\nThere might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given\nconvincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a budding\nphilosopher; for, often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to\nprophesy, with ominous nods, \"That child ain't long for this world,\" he\nwould turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with\nwhich dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight their\nparents' souls.\n\nMeg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them; but what mother was\never proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, or the\ntranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show\nthemselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?\n\n\"No more raisins, Demi, they'll make you sick,\" says mamma to the young\nperson who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity\non plum-pudding day.\n\n\"Me likes to be sick.\"\n\n\"I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty-cakes.\"\n\nHe reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit; and, by\nand by, when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits mamma by a\nshrewd bargain.\n\n\"Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you like,\" says\nMeg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding is\nsafely bouncing in the pot.\n\n\"Truly, marmar?\" asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered\nhead.\n\n\"Yes, truly; anything you say,\" replies the short-sighted parent,\npreparing herself to sing \"The Three Little Kittens\" half a dozen times\nover, or to take her family to \"Buy a penny bun,\" regardless of wind or\nlimb. But Demi corners her by the cool reply,--\n\n\"Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins.\"\n\nAunt Dodo was chief playmate and _confidante_ of both children, and the\ntrio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet only a\nname to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but\nAunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for which\ncompliment she was deeply grateful. But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo\nneglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their\nlittle souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost\nher best customer and became bankrupt; Demi, with infantile penetration,\nsoon discovered that Dodo liked to play with \"the bear-man\" better than\nshe did with him; but, though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he\nhadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate-drops in\nhis waistcoat-pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case\nand freely shaken by ardent admirers.\n\nSome persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes;\nbut Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to patronize the\n\"bear-man\" with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small\naffections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her\nthrone, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures of surpassing worth.\n\nGentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the\nyoung relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard; but this\ncounterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not\ndeceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however\nlikewise effective,--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law;\nhe was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked\nparticularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his\nmanly one. His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to day,\nbut evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always asked\nfor Mr. March, so I suppose _he_ was the attraction. The excellent papa\nlabored under the delusion that he was, and revelled in long discussions\nwith the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing\ngrandson suddenly enlightened him.\n\nMr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,\nastonished by the spectacle that met his eye. Prone upon the floor lay\nMr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him,\nlikewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own\nshort, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovellers so seriously absorbed\nthat they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his\nsonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face,--\n\n\"Father, father, here's the Professor!\"\n\nDown went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor\nsaid, with undisturbed dignity,--\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for a moment; we are just finishing\nour lesson.
