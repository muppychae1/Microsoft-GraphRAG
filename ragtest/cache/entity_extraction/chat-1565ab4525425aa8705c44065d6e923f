You are not afraid of anything, you know,\"\nreturned the boy, looking wicked.\n\n\"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I should\nbe. Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse for\nit,\" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the door.\n\n\"I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only\nafraid you are very tired talking to me; it was _so_ pleasant, I\ncouldn't bear to stop,\" said Laurie gratefully.\n\n\"The doctor to see you, sir,\" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.\n\n\"Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him,\"\nsaid Laurie.\n\n\"Don't mind me. I'm as happy as a cricket here,\" answered Jo.\n\nLaurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was\nstanding before a fine portrait of the old gentleman, when the door\nopened again, and, without turning, she said decidedly, \"I'm sure now\nthat I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his\nmouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.\nHe isn't as handsome as _my_ grandfather, but I like him.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said a gruff voice behind her; and there, to her\ngreat dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.\n\nPoor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began\nto beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. For a\nminute a wild desire to run away possessed her; but that was cowardly,\nand the girls would laugh at her: so she resolved to stay, and get out\nof the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living\neyes, under the bushy gray eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted\nones; and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a\ngood deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman\nsaid abruptly, after that dreadful pause, \"So you're not afraid of me,\nhey?\"\n\n\"Not much, sir.\"\n\n\"And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?\"\n\n\"Not quite, sir.\"\n\n\"And I've got a tremendous will, have I?\"\n\n\"I only said I thought so.\"\n\n\"But you like me, in spite of it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, sir.\"\n\nThat answer pleased the old gentleman; he gave a short laugh, shook\nhands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her\nface, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying, with a nod, \"You've\ngot your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face. He _was_ a fine\nman, my dear; but, what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and\nI was proud to be his friend.\"\n\n           [Illustration: Putting his finger under her chin]\n\n\"Thank you, sir;\" and Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited\nher exactly.\n\n\"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\" was the next\nquestion, sharply put.\n\n\"Only trying to be neighborly, sir;\" and Jo told how her visit came\nabout.\n\n\"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good\nperhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,\nfor we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\" said Jo\neagerly.\n\n\"Tut, tut, tut! that was the boy's affair. How is the poor woman?\"\n\n\"Doing nicely, sir;\" and off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all\nabout the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends than\nthey were.\n\n\"Just her father's way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother\nsome fine day. Tell her so. There's the tea-bell; we have it early, on\nthe boy's account. Come down, and go on being neighborly.\"\n\n\"If you'd like to have me, sir.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't;\" and Mr. Laurence offered her his arm\nwith old-fashioned courtesy.\n\n\"What _would_ Meg say to this?\" thought Jo, as she was marched away,\nwhile her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story\nat home.\n\n\"Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\" said the old\ngentleman, as Laurie came running down stairs, and brought up with a\nstart of surprise at the astonishing sight of Jo arm-in-arm with his\nredoubtable grandfather.\n\n\"I didn't know you'd come, sir,\" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant\nlittle glance.\n\n\"That's evident, by the way you racket down stairs. Come to your tea,\nsir, and behave like a gentleman;\" and having pulled the boy's hair by\nway of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
