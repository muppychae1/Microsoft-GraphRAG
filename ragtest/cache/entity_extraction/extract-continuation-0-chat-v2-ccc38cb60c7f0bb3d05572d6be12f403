Aunt woke up; and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me\nto read a bit, and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy\nand instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though\nshe only said,--\n\n\"'I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it, child.'\n\n\"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could.\nOnce I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,\n'I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am; sha'n't I stop now?'\n\n\"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me\na sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way,--\n\n\"'Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss.'\"\n\n\"Did she own she liked it?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"Oh, bless you, no! but she let old Belsham rest; and, when I ran back\nafter my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar that\nshe didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall, because of the\ngood time coming. What a pleasant life she might have, if she only\nchose. I don't envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich\npeople have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,\" added Jo.\n\n\"That reminds me,\" said Meg, \"that I've got something to tell. It isn't\nfunny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came\nhome. At the Kings to-day I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the\nchildren said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and\npapa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking\nvery loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed\nme, so I shouldn't see how red their eyes were. I didn't ask any\nquestions, of course; but I felt so sorry for them, and was rather glad\nI hadn't any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family.\"\n\n\"I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try_inger_ than\nanything bad boys can do,\" said Amy, shaking her head, as if her\nexperience of life had been a deep one. \"Susie Perkins came to school\nto-day with a lovely red carnelian ring; I wanted it dreadfully, and\nwished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew a picture of Mr.\nDavis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, 'Young ladies,\nmy eye is upon you!' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were\nlaughing over it, when all of a sudden his eye _was_ on us, and he\nordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was _parry_lized with fright,\nbut she went, and oh, what _do_ you think he did? He took her by the\near, the ear! just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation\nplatform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding that slate so\nevery one could see.\"\n\n          [Illustration: He took her by the ear! by the ear!]\n\n\"Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?\" asked Jo, who relished the\nscrape.\n\n\"Laugh? Not one! They sat as still as mice; and Susie cried quarts, I\nknow she did. I didn't envy her then; for I felt that millions of\ncarnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy, after that. I never, never\nshould have got over such a agonizing mortification.\" And Amy went on\nwith her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue, and the successful\nutterance of two long words in a breath.\n\n\"I saw something that I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at\ndinner, but I forgot,\" said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in\norder as she talked. \"When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr.\nLaurence was in the fish-shop; but he didn't see me, for I kept behind a\nbarrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter, the fish-man. A poor woman came\nin, with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do\nsome scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any dinner for her\nchildren, and had been disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a\nhurry, and said 'No,' rather crossly; so she was going away, looking\nhungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the\ncrooked end of his cane, and held it out to her. She was so glad and\nsurprised, she took it right in her arms, and thanked him over and over.\nHe told her to 'go along and cook it,' and she hurried off, so happy!\nWasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big,\nslippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 'aisy.'\"\n\n           [Illustration: Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish]\n\nWhen they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one;\nand, after a moment's thought, she said soberly,--\n\n\"As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets to-day, at the rooms, I felt\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUNT<|>PERSON<|>Aunt is a good-natured individual who enjoys reading and instructing others)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELSHAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Belsham is a worthy and instructive work that Aunt prefers over frivolous works)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character who enjoys telling stories and dancing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a character who enjoys listening to stories and discussing serious matters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KINGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kings is a family experiencing turmoil due to a family member's actions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
