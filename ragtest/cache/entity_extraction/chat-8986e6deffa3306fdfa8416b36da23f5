You don't care to make people like you, to go\ninto good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and I\nmean to make the most of every chance that comes. _You_ can go through\nthe world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it\nindependence, if you like. That's not my way.\"\n\nWhen Amy whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best\nof it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side, while Jo\ncarried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an\nunlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an\nargument. Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a good\nhit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more amiable\nturn. Much against her will, Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day\nto Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she regarded as \"a\nnonsensical business.\"\n\nThe invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following Monday\nwas set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out of humor because her\nweek's work was deranged, and prophesied that \"ef the washin' and\nironin' warn't done reg'lar nothin' would go well anywheres.\" This hitch\nin the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the\nwhole concern; but Amy's motto was \"Nil desperandum,\" and having made up\nher mind what to do, she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles.\nTo begin with, Hannah's cooking didn't turn out well: the chicken was\ntough, the tongue too salt, and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.\nThen the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon; and\nvarious other expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up\nrather alarmingly afterward. Beth got cold and took to her bed, Meg had\nan unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a\ndivided state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were\nuncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.\n\n\"If it hadn't been for mother I never should have got through,\" as Amy\ndeclared afterward, and gratefully remembered when \"the best joke of the\nseason\" was entirely forgotten by everybody else.\n\nIf it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on\nTuesday,--an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last\ndegree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which\nis more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a\nlittle, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late\nfor any one else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people\nout of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be\ngot in order. The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby; but\nwithout stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skilfully made the\nbest of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the\ncarpet, covering stains on the walls with pictures framed in ivy, and\nfilling up empty corners with home-made statuary, which gave an artistic\nair to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.\n\nThe lunch looked charmingly; and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped\nit would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver\nwould get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and mother\nwere all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah behind the\nscenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, an\naching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything\nwould allow, and, as she wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with\nanticipations of the happy moment, when, lunch safely over, she should\ndrive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights; for\nthe \"cherry-bounce\" and the broken bridge were her strong points.\n\nThen came two hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor\nto porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. A smart\nshower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young\nladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came; and at two the\nexhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the\nperishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.\n\n\"No doubt about the weather to-day; they will certainly come, so we must\nfly round and be ready for them,\" said Amy, as the sun woke her next\nmorning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had\nsaid nothing about Tuesday, for her interest, like her cake, was getting\na little stale.\n\n\"I can't get any lobsters, so\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
