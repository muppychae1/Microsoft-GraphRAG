Jo, with\nperfect faith in her own powers, and a friendly desire to make up the\nquarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to\ndinner.\n\n\"You'd better see what you have got before you think of having company,\"\nsaid Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.\n\n\"Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes; and I shall get some\nasparagus, and a lobster, 'for a relish,' as Hannah says. We'll have\nlettuce, and make a salad. I don't know how, but the book tells. I'll\nhave blanc-mange and strawberries for dessert; and coffee, too, if you\nwant to be elegant.\"\n\n\"Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but\ngingerbread and molasses candy, fit to eat. I wash my hands of the\ndinner-party; and, since you have asked Laurie on your own\nresponsibility, you may just take care of him.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him, and help to the\npudding. You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?\"\nasked Jo, rather hurt.\n\n\"Yes; but I don't know much, except about bread, and a few trifles. You\nhad better ask mother's leave before you order anything,\" returned Meg\nprudently.\n\n\"Of course I shall; I'm not a fool,\" and Jo went off in a huff at the\ndoubts expressed of her powers.\n\n\"Get what you like, and don't disturb me; I'm going out to dinner, and\ncan't worry about things at home,\" said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to\nher. \"I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation\nto-day, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.\"\n\nThe unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably, and\nreading, early in the morning, made Jo feel as if some natural\nphenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic\neruption would hardly have seemed stranger.\n\n\"Everything is out of sorts, somehow,\" she said to herself, going down\nstairs. \"There's Beth crying; that's a sure sign that something is wrong\nwith this family. If Amy is bothering, I'll shake her.\"\n\nFeeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to\nfind Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage, with\nhis little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for\nwant of which he had died.\n\n\"It's all my fault--I forgot him--there isn't a seed or a drop left. O\nPip! O Pip! how could I be so cruel to you?\" cried Beth, taking the poor\nthing in her hands, and trying to restore him.\n\n                     [Illustration: O Pip! O Pip!]\n\nJo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding him\nstiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino-box for a coffin.\n\n\"Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,\" said Amy\nhopefully.\n\n\"He's been starved, and he sha'n't be baked, now he's dead. I'll make\nhim a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden; and I'll never have\nanother bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,\" murmured\nBeth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.\n\n\"The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now, don't\ncry, Bethy; it's a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has\nhad the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud, and lay him in my box;\nand, after the dinner-party, we'll have a nice little funeral,\" said Jo,\nbeginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.\n\nLeaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which\nwas in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on a big apron,\nshe fell to work, and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when\nshe discovered that the fire was out.\n\n\"Here's a sweet prospect!\" muttered Jo, slamming the stove-door open,\nand poking vigorously among the cinders.\n\nHaving rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the\nwater heated. The walk revived her spirits; and, flattering herself that\nshe had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a very\nyoung lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid\nstrawberries. By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived, and\nthe stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had\nworked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
