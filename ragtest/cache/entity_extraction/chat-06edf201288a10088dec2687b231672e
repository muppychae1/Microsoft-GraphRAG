Then he avoided the tender\nsubject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,\nand gave out that he was going to \"dig,\" intending to graduate in a\nblaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than twilight\nconfidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the\neye; for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred\nimaginary heroes to real ones, because, when tired of them, the former\ncould be shut up in the tin-kitchen till called for, and the latter were\nless manageable.\n\nThings were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo\nwatched Laurie that night as she had never done before. If she had not\ngot the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in\nthe fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her. But\nhaving given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at\na great pace; and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course\nof romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual, Beth lay on\nthe sofa, and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all\nsorts of gossip; for she depended on her weekly \"spin,\" and he never\ndisappointed her. But that evening, Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested\non the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she\nlistened with intense interest to an account of some exciting\ncricket-match, though the phrases, \"caught off a tice,\" \"stumped off his\nground,\" and \"the leg hit for three,\" were as intelligible to her as\nSanscrit. She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it, that\nshe saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that he\ndropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a little\nabsent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an assiduity\nthat was really almost tender.\n\n\"Who knows? stranger things have happened,\" thought Jo, as she fussed\nabout the room. \"She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make\nlife delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love each\nother. I don't see how he can help it; and I do believe he would if the\nrest of us were out of the way.\"\n\nAs every one _was_ out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that\nshe ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where should she go?\nand burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she sat\ndown to settle that point.\n\nNow, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa,--long, broad,\nwell-cushioned, and low; a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the\ngirls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back, rode\non the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested tired\nheads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young women.\nThey all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always\nbeen Jo's favorite lounging-place. Among the many pillows that adorned\nthe venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly\nhorsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end; this\nrepulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon of\ndefence, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.\n\nLaurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep\naversion, having been unmercifully pummelled with it in former days,\nwhen romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from taking\nthe seat he most coveted, next to Jo in the sofa corner. If \"the\nsausage\" as they called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might\napproach and repose; but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to the man,\nwoman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot to\nbarricade her corner, and had not been in her seat five minutes, before\na massive form appeared beside her, and, with both arms spread over the\nsofa-back, both long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed,\nwith a sigh of satisfaction,--\n\n\"Now, _this_ is filling at the price.\"\n\n           [Illustration: Now, this is filling at the price]\n\n\"No slang,\" snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was too late,\nthere was no room for it; and, coasting on to the floor, it disappeared\nin a most mysterious manner.\n\n\"Come, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton all the\nweek, a fellow deserves petting, and ought to get it.\"\n\n\"Beth will pet you; I'm busy.\"\n\n\"No, she's not to be bothered with me; but you like that sort of thing,\nunless you've suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you? Do you hate\nyour boy, and want to fire pillows at him?\"\n\nAnything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard,\nbut Jo quenched \"her boy\" by turning on him with the stern query,--\n\n\"How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?\"\n\n\"Not one, upon my word. She's engaged. Now then.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it; that's one of your foolish extravagances,--sending\nflowers and things to girls for whom you\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
