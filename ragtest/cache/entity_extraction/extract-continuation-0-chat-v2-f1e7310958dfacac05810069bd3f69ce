She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt\nsome disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin.\nNed Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn't help\ncontrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid\noutfit, with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But\nsomehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the\npatient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her;\nand when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small\nplans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot\nSallie's splendor, and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in\nChristendom.\n\nJo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to\nAmy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of\nthe best teachers going; and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would\nhave served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her\nafternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo, meantime, devoted\nherself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the\nfever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again\nthe rosy, healthy creature she had been; yet always hopeful, happy, and\nserene, busy with the quiet duties she loved, every one's friend, and an\nangel in the house, long before those who loved her most had learned to\nknow it.\n\nAs long as \"The Spread Eagle\" paid her a dollar a column for her\n\"rubbish,\" as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun\nher little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her busy\nbrain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a\nslowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place\nthe name of March upon the roll of fame.\n\nLaurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was\nnow getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please\nhimself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,\nand the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to\nget other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being spoilt,\nand probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had\nnot possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man\nwho was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who watched over\nhim as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the\nknowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him\nwith all their hearts.\n\nBeing only \"a glorious human boy,\" of course he frolicked and flirted,\ngrew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions\nordained; hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came\nperilously near suspension and expulsion. But as high spirits and the\nlove of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save\nhimself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible\npower of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather\nprided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with\ngraphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified\nprofessors, and vanquished enemies. The \"men of my class\" were heroes in\nthe eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of \"our\nfellows,\" and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these\ngreat creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.\n\nAmy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among\nthem; for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of\nfascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her\nprivate and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and\nBeth too shy to do more than peep at them, and wonder how Amy dared to\norder them about so; but Jo felt quite in her element, and found it very\ndifficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases,\nand feats, which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed\nfor young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love\nwith her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a\nsentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine. And speaking of sentiment\nbrings us very naturally to the \"Dove-cote.\"\n\nThat was the name of the little brown house which Mr. Brooke had\nprepared for Meg's first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was\nhighly appropriate to the gentle lovers, who \"went on together like a\npair of turtle-doves, with first a bill and then a coo.\" It was a tiny\nhouse, with a little garden behind, and a lawn about as big as a\npocket-handkerchief in front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain,\nshrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers; though just at present,\nthe fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a\ndilapidated slop-bowl; the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,\nundecided whether to live or die; and the profusion of flowers was\nmerely hinted by regiments of sticks, to show where seeds were planted.\nBut inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault\nfrom garret to cellar.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NED MOFFAT<|>PERSON<|>Ned Moffat recently married Sallie Gardiner)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALLIE GARDINER<|>PERSON<|>Sallie Gardiner recently married Ned Moffat)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is devoted to literature)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is taking drawing lessons from a top teacher)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth remains delicate after a fever)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a universal favorite at college)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
