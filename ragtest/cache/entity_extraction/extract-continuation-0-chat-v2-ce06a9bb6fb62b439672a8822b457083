How Jo did enjoy her\n\"wilderness of boys,\" and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented\nhad she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered\nPlumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys! There was a sort of\npoetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror\nof the boys for miles round; and now the exiles feasted freely on\nforbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved, and\nplayed cricket in the big field where the irritable \"cow with a crumpled\nhorn\" used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. It became a sort\nof boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be called the\n\"Bhaer-garten,\" as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its\ninhabitants.\n\nIt never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a\nfortune; but it _was_ just what Jo intended it to be,--\"a happy,\nhomelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness.\"\nEvery room in the big house was soon full; every little plot in the\ngarden soon had its owner; a regular menagerie appeared in barn and\nshed, for pet animals were allowed; and, three times a day, Jo smiled at\nher Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows\nof happy young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes,\nconfiding words, and grateful hearts, full of love for \"Mother Bhaer.\"\nShe had boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not\nangels, by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and\nProfessorin much trouble and anxiety. But her faith in the good spot\nwhich exists in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing\nlittle ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and, in time, success; for\nno mortal boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as\nbenevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times\nseven. Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads; their\npenitent sniffs and whispers after wrong-doing; their droll or touching\nlittle confidences; their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans; even\ntheir misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more.\nThere were slow boys and bashful boys; feeble boys and riotous boys;\nboys that lisped and boys that stuttered; one or two lame ones; and a\nmerry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was\nwelcome to the \"Bhaer-garten,\" though some people predicted that his\nadmission would ruin the school.\n\nYes; Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much\nanxiety, and a perpetual racket. She enjoyed it heartily, and found the\napplause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world; for\nnow she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers\nand admirers. As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to\nincrease her happiness,--Rob, named for grandpa, and Teddy, a\nhappy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa's sunshiny\ntemper as well as his mother's lively spirit. How they ever grew up\nalive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and\naunts; but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough\nnurses loved and served them well.\n\nThere were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most\ndelightful was the yearly apple-picking; for then the Marches,\nLaurences, Brookes, and Bhaers turned out in full force, and made a day\nof it. Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals\noccurred,--a mellow October day, when the air was full of an\nexhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise, and the blood dance\nhealthily in the veins. The old orchard wore its holiday attire;\ngolden-rod and asters fringed the mossy walls; grasshoppers skipped\nbriskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a\nfeast; squirrels were busy with their small harvesting; birds twittered\ntheir adieux from the alders in the lane; and every tree stood ready to\nsend down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake.\nEverybody was there; everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled\ndown; everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or\nsuch a jolly set to enjoy it; and every one gave themselves up to the\nsimple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things\nas care or sorrow in the world.\n\nMr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and Columella\nto Mr. Laurence, while enjoying--\n\n        \"The gentle apple's winey juice.\"\n\nThe Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout Teutonic\nknight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made a hook\nand ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PLUMFIELD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plumfield is a school founded by Jo as a happy, homelike place for boys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is the founder of Plumfield and the caretaker of the boys at the school)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR<|>PERSON<|>The Professor is a wise figure who helps steer Jo and the boys at Plumfield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Aunt March is a character who would have disapproved of the chaos at Plumfield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMS, DICKS, AND HARRYS<|>PERSON<|>Boys who have overrun Plumfield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie suggests naming Plumfield the \"Bhaer-garten\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FATHER BHAER<|>PERSON<|>Father Bhaer is a benevolent figure at Plumfield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER BHAER<|>PERSON<|>Mother Bhaer is a forgiving figure at Plumfield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIENDSHIP OF THE LADS<|>EVENT<|>The friendship and interactions between Jo and the boys at Plumfield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROB<|>PERSON<|>Jo's son named after grandpa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEDDY<|>PERSON<|>Jo's son with a sunshiny temper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANDMA AND AUNTS<|>PERSON<|>Family members who wonder how Jo's sons survive in the chaos at Plumfield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCHES, LAURENCES, BROOKES, AND BHAERS<|>PERSON<|>Families who participate in the yearly apple-picking festival)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
