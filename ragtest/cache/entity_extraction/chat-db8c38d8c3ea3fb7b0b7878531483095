I won't bear it.\"\n\n\"He won't come, sir; he feels badly because you didn't believe him when\nhe said he couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his feelings very\nmuch.\"\n\nJo tried to look pathetic, but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began\nto laugh, and she knew the day was won.\n\n\"I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking _me_, I\nsuppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?\" and the old gentleman\nlooked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.\n\n\"If I were you, I'd write him an apology, sir. He says he won't come\ndown till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an\nabsurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and\nbring him down quite amiable. Try it; he likes fun, and this way is\nbetter than talking. I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty.\"\n\nMr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying\nslowly, \"You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed by you and\nBeth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this\nnonsense.\"\n\nThe note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to\nanother after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on the top of\nMr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under Laurie's\ndoor, advising him, through the key-hole, to be submissive, decorous,\nand a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door locked\nagain, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly away,\nwhen the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at\nthe bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of countenance,\n\"What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?\" he added,\nlaughing.\n\n\"No; he was pretty mild, on the whole.\"\n\n\"Ah! I got it all round; even you cast me off over there, and I felt\njust ready to go to the deuce,\" he began apologetically.\n\n\"Don't talk in that way; turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my\nson.\"\n\n\"I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil\nmy copy-books; and I make so many beginnings there never will be an\nend,\" he said dolefully.\n\n\"Go and eat your dinner; you'll feel better after it. Men always croak\nwhen they are hungry,\" and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.\n\n\"That's a 'label' on my 'sect,'\" answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he\nwent to partake of humble-pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was\nquite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the\nrest of the day.\n\nEvery one thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over; but\nthe mischief was done, for, though others forgot it, Meg remembered. She\nnever alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good deal,\ndreamed dreams more than ever; and once Jo, rummaging her sister's desk\nfor stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words, \"Mrs.\nJohn Brooke;\" whereat she groaned tragically, and cast it into the fire,\nfeeling that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day for her.\n\n\n\n\n  [Illustration: Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day]\n\n                                 XXII.\n\n                           PLEASANT MEADOWS.\n\n\nLike sunshine after storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. The\ninvalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning\nearly in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all\nday, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats, at first, and, in time,\nwith doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behindhand. Her once active\nlimbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her a daily airing about the\nhouse in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burnt her white\nhands cooking delicate messes for \"the dear;\" while Amy, a loyal slave\nof the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her\ntreasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.\n\nAs Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,\nand Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible\nor magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry\nChristmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had\nbonfires, sky-rockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.\nAfter many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered\neffectually quenched, and went about with forlorn faces, which were\nrather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.\n\nSeveral days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid\nChristmas Day. Hannah \"felt in her bones\" that it was going to be an\nunusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for\neverybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To\nbegin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them; then Beth\nfelt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's\ngift,--a soft crimson merino\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
