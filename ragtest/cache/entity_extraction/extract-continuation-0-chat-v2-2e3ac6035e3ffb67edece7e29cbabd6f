If she only would get\nquite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn't have a wish in the world.\"\n\n\"Happy woman! I've got heaps.\"\n\n\"My dear, what are they?\"\n\n\"I'll settle Bethy's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine. They are not\nvery wearing, so they'll keep;\" and Jo stitched away, with a wise nod\nwhich set her mother's heart at rest about her, for the present at\nleast.\n\nWhile apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth; and,\nafter many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which\nseemed to explain the change in her. A slight incident gave Jo the clue\nto the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did the\nrest. She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon, when she\nand Beth were alone together; yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on\nher sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting at the window, Beth's\nwork often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her hand,\nin a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull, autumnal\nlandscape. Suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic\nblackbird, and a voice called out,--\n\n           [Illustration: She leaned her head upon her hands]\n\n\"All serene! Coming in to-night.\"\n\nBeth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by\ntill his quick tramp died away, then said softly, as if to herself,--\n\n\"How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face; for the bright\ncolor faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a\ntear lay shining on the window-ledge. Beth whisked it off, and glanced\napprehensively at Jo; but she was scratching away at a tremendous rate,\napparently engrossed in \"Olympia's Oath.\" The instant Beth turned, Jo\nbegan her watch again, saw Beth's hand go quietly to her eyes more than\nonce, and, in her half-averted face, read a tender sorrow that made her\nown eyes fill. Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring\nsomething about needing more paper.\n\n\"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!\" she said, sitting down in her own\nroom, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had\njust made. \"I never dreamt of such a thing. What _will_ mother say? I\nwonder if he--\" there Jo stopped, and turned scarlet with a sudden\nthought. \"If he shouldn't love back again, how dreadful it would be. He\nmust; I'll make him!\" and she shook her head threateningly at the\npicture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.\n\"Oh dear, we _are_ growing up with a vengeance. Here's Meg married and a\nmamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love. I'm the only one\nthat has sense enough to keep out of mischief.\" Jo thought intently for\na minute, with her eyes fixed on the picture; then she smoothed out her\nwrinkled forehead, and said, with a decided nod at the face opposite,\n\"No, thank you, sir; you're very charming, but you've no more stability\nthan a weathercock; so you needn't write touching notes, and smile in\nthat insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I won't have\nit.\"\n\nThen she sighed, and fell into a reverie, from which she did not wake\ntill the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which\nonly confirmed her suspicion. Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked\nwith Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,\nbut so was everybody's; therefore, no one thought of imagining that he\ncared more for her than for the others. Indeed, a general impression had\nprevailed in the family, of late, that \"our boy\" was getting fonder than\never of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject, and\nscolded violently if any one dared to suggest it. If they had known the\nvarious tender passages of the past year, or rather attempts at tender\npassages which had been nipped in the bud, they would have had the\nimmense satisfaction of saying, \"I told you so.\" But Jo hated\n\"philandering,\" and wouldn't allow it, always having a joke or a smile\nready at the least sign of impending danger.\n\nWhen Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month;\nbut these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much\namused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope, despair,\nand resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly\nconferences. But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many\nshrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged\noccasionally in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender\nsubject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,\nand gave out that he was going to \"dig,\" intending to graduate in a\nblaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than twilight\nconfidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the\neye; for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred\nimaginary heroes to real ones, because\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VERDANTIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Verdantis is a country with a Central Institution that sets interest rates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Central Institution is the Federal Reserve of Verdantis, which is setting interest rates on Monday and Thursday)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Martin Smith is the chair of the Central Institution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET STRATEGY COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Central Institution committee makes key decisions about interest rates and the growth of Verdantis's money supply)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>Martin Smith is the Chair of the Central Institution and will answer questions at a press conference<|>9)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
