What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?\"\n\n\"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a\ngymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and\nwe'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.\"\n\nLaurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several\npassers-by smile in spite of themselves.\n\n\"I'll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not; it's grand fun, and will\nstraighten you up capitally. But I don't believe that was your only\nreason for saying 'I'm glad,' in that decided way; was it, now?\"\n\n\"No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you\nnever go to such places. Do you?\"\n\n\"Not often.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't.\"\n\n\"It's no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it's no fun unless you\nhave good players; so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes and have a\ngame with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and better,\nand will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys. I did\nhope you'd stay respectable, and be a satisfaction to your friends,\"\nsaid Jo, shaking her head.\n\n\"Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without\nlosing his respectability?\" asked Laurie, looking nettled.\n\n\"That depends upon how and where he takes it. I don't like Ned and his\nset, and wish you'd keep out of it. Mother won't let us have him at our\nhouse, though he wants to come; and if you grow like him she won't be\nwilling to have us frolic together as we do now.\"\n\n\"Won't she?\" asked Laurie anxiously.\n\n\"No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us all up in\nbandboxes rather than have us associate with them.\"\n\n\"Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet; I'm not a fashionable\nparty, and don't mean to be; but I do like harmless larks now and then,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you? or\nthere will be an end of all our good times.\"\n\n\"I'll be a double-distilled saint.\"\n\n\"I can't bear saints: just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and\nwe'll never desert you. I don't know what I _should_ do if you acted\nlike Mr. King's son; he had plenty of money, but didn't know how to\nspend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his\nfather's name, I believe, and was altogether horrid.\"\n\n\"You think I'm likely to do the same? Much obliged.\"\n\n\"No, I don't--oh, _dear_, no!--but I hear people talking about money\nbeing such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor; I shouldn't\nworry then.\"\n\n\"Do you worry about me, Jo?\"\n\n\"A little, when you look moody or discontented, as you sometimes do; for\nyou've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I'm afraid\nit would be hard to stop you.\"\n\nLaurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she\nhad held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips still\nsmiled as if at her warnings.\n\n\"Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?\" he asked\npresently.\n\n\"Of course not; why?\"\n\n\"Because if you are, I'll take a 'bus; if you are not, I'd like to walk\nwith you, and tell you something very interesting.\"\n\n\"I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news immensely.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; come on. It's a secret, and if I tell you, you must\ntell me yours.\"\n\n\"I haven't got any,\" began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that\nshe had.\n\n\"You know you have,--you can't hide anything; so up and 'fess, or I\nwon't tell,\" cried Laurie.\n\n\"Is your secret a nice one?\"\n\n\"Oh, isn't it! all about people you know, and such fun! You ought to\nhear it, and I've been aching to tell it this long time. Come, you\nbegin.\"\n\n\"You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"And you won't tease me in private?\"\n\n\"I never tease.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do; you get everything you want out of people. I don't know\nhow you do it, but you are a born wheedler.\"\n\n\"Thank you; fire away.\"\n\n\"Well, I've left two stories with a newspaper man, and he's to give his\nanswer next week,\" whispered Jo, in her confidant's ear.\n\n\"Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!\" cried\nLaurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight\nof two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children; for\nthey were out of the city now.\n\n                 [Illustration: Hurrah for Miss March]\n\n\"Hush!
