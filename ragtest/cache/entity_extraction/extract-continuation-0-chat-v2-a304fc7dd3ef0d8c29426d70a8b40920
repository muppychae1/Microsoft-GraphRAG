It's not a fashionable place, but uncle stopped here\n    years ago, and won't go anywhere else; however, we don't mean to\n    stay long, so it's no great matter. Oh, I can't begin to tell\n    you how I enjoy it all! I never can, so I'll only give you bits\n    out of my note-book, for I've done nothing but sketch and\n    scribble since I started.\n\n    \"I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but\n    after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day,\n    with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. Every one was very\n    kind to me, especially the officers. Don't laugh, Jo; gentlemen\n    really are very necessary aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait\n    upon one; and as they have nothing to do, it's a mercy to make\n    them useful, otherwise they would smoke themselves to death, I'm\n    afraid.\n\n        [Illustration: \"Every one was very kind, especially the\n                         officers.\"--Page 378.]\n\n    \"Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let\n    alone, so when I had done what I could for them, I went and\n    enjoyed myself. Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid\n    air and waves! It was almost as exciting as riding a fast\n    horse, when we went rushing on so grandly. I wish Beth could\n    have come, it would have done her so much good; as for Jo, she\n    would have gone up and sat on the main-top jib, or whatever the\n    high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and\n    tooted on the captain's speaking-trumpet, she'd have been in\n    such a state of rapture.\n\n    \"It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and\n    found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here\n    and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's\n    country-seats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It\n    was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up to see\n    it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore _so_\n    picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I never shall forget it.\n\n    \"At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us,--Mr.\n    Lennox,--and when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney,\n    he sighed and sung, with a look at me,--\n\n        'Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?\n         She lives on the banks of Killarney;\n         From the glance of her eye,\n         Shun danger and fly,\n         For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney.'\n\n    Wasn't that nonsensical?\n\n    \"We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It's a dirty, noisy\n    place, and I was glad to leave it. Uncle rushed out and bought a\n    pair of dog-skin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an\n    umbrella, and got shaved _à la_ mutton-chop, the first thing.\n    Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true Briton; but\n    the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes, the little\n    bootblack knew that an American stood in them, and said, with a\n    grin, 'There yer har, sir. I've give 'em the latest Yankee\n    shine.' It amused uncle immensely. Oh, I _must_ tell you what\n    that absurd Lennox did! He got his friend Ward, who came on with\n    us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my\n    room was a lovely one, with 'Robert Lennox's compliments,' on\n    the card.

The very cattle looked more tranquil than\n    ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a\n    contented cluck, as if they never got nervous, like Yankee\n    biddies.
