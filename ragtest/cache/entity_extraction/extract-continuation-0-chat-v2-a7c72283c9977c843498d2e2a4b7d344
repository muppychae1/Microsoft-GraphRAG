Father is as\nregular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, perhaps.\"\n\nA sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a\nletter.\n\n\"It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,\" she said, handing it as\nif she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.\n\n          [Illustration: One of them horrid telegraph things]\n\nAt the word \"telegraph,\" Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it\ncontained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little\npaper had sent a bullet to her heart. Laurie dashed down stairs for\nwater, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a\nfrightened voice,--\n\n    \"MRS. MARCH:\n\n    \"Your husband is very ill. Come at once.\n                           \"S. HALE,\n                \"Blank Hospital, Washington\"\n\nHow still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the\nday darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change,\nas the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the\nhappiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.\nMrs. March was herself again directly; read the message over, and\nstretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never\nforgot, \"I shall go at once, but it may be too late. O children,\nchildren, help me to bear it!\"\n\nFor several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the\nroom, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help,\nand hopeful whispers that died away in tears. Poor Hannah was the first\nto recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good\nexample; for, with her, work was the panacea for most afflictions.\n\n\"The Lord keep the dear man! I won't waste no time a cryin', but git\nyour things ready right away, mum,\" she said, heartily, as she wiped her\nface on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her\nown hard one, and went away, to work like three women in one.\n\n\"She's right; there's no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, and let me\nthink.\"\n\nThey tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking\npale, but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.\n\n\"Where's Laurie?\" she asked presently, when she had collected her\nthoughts, and decided on the first duties to be done.\n\n\"Here, ma'am. Oh, let me do something!\" cried the boy, hurrying from the\nnext room, whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow was\ntoo sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.\n\n\"Send a telegram saying I will come at once. The next train goes early\nin the morning. I'll take that.\"\n\n\"What else? The horses are ready; I can go anywhere, do anything,\" he\nsaid, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.\n\n\"Leave a note at Aunt March's. Jo, give me that pen and paper.\"\n\nTearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew the\ntable before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad\njourney must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to add\na little to the sum for her father.\n\n\"Now go, dear; but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate pace;\nthere is no need of that.\"\n\nMrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away; for five minutes later\nLaurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his\nlife.\n\n\"Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come. On the way\nget these things. I'll put them down; they'll be needed, and I must go\nprepared for nursing. Hospital stores are not always good. Beth, go and\nask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine: I'm not too proud\nto beg for father; he shall have the best of everything. Amy, tell\nHannah to get down the black trunk; and, Meg, come and help me find my\nthings, for I'm half bewildered.\"\n\nWriting, thinking, and directing, all at once, might well bewilder the\npoor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little\nwhile, and let them work. Every one scattered like leaves before a gust\nof wind; and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if\nthe paper had been an evil spell.\n\nMr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the\nkind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest\npromises of protection for the girls during the mother's absence, which\ncomforted her very much. There was nothing he didn't offer, from his own\ndressing-gown to himself as escort. But that last was impossible.
