Amy was drawing\nthe lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light\nof which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not\ncopy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who\nheld her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead\nhim along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low\nseat, with the grave, quiet look which best became her; and Laurie,\nleaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly\nhead, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long\nglass which reflected them both.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo grouped, the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.

The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with\nhis books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature\nas by grace,--a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better\nthan learning, the charity which calls all mankind \"brother,\" the piety\nthat blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.\n\nThese attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which\nshut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many\nadmirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as\nnaturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard\nexperience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men found the\ngray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled\nwomen instinctively brought their doubts and sorrows to him, sure of\nfinding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel; sinners told their\nsins to the pure-hearted old man, and were both rebuked and saved;\ngifted men found a companion in him; ambitious men caught glimpses of\nnobler ambitions than their own; and even worldlings confessed that his\nbeliefs were beautiful and true, although \"they wouldn't pay.\"\n\nTo outsiders, the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so\nthey did in many things; but the quiet scholar, sitting among his books,\nwas still the head of the family, the household conscience, anchor, and\ncomforter; for to him the busy, anxious women always turned in troublous\ntimes, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred words, husband\nand father.\n\nThe girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls\ninto their father's; and to both parents, who lived and labored so\nfaithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth, and\nbound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and\noutlives death.\n\nMrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we\nsaw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the\nhospitals and homes, still full of wounded \"boys\" and soldiers' widows,\ndecidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.\n\nJohn Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent\nhome, and not allowed to return. He received no stars or bars, but he\ndeserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had; and life and love\nare very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his\ndischarge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business,\nand earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy independence\nthat characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more generous offers,\nand accepted the place of book-keeper feeling better satisfied to begin\nwith an honestly-earned salary, than by running any risks with borrowed\nmoney.\n\nMeg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly in\ncharacter, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever; for love is\na great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt\nsome disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin.\nNed Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn't help\ncontrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid\noutfit, with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But\nsomehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the\npatient love and labor John had put into\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character in the text, described as having bright eyes and a pleasant prospect)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FATHER<|>PERSON<|>Father is a character in the text, sitting with mother and reliving their romance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER<|>PERSON<|>Mother is a character in the text, sitting with father and reliving their romance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a character in the text, drawing the lovers in a beautiful world)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is a character in the text, talking cheerily with her old friend)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character in the text, leaning on Jo's chair and smiling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a character in the text, part of the group with Jo, Beth, and Amy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCHES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Marches are a family in the text, experiencing changes over three years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
