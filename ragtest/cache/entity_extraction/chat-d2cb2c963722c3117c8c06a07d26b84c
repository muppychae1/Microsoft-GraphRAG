I've been at it\ntill I'm all worn out. Do come and help me or I _shall_ die!\" and the\nexhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet\nwelcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized\nat the same time as the floor.\n\n\"What worries you, dear? Has anything dreadful happened?\" asked the\nanxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was\nall askew.\n\n\"Yes,\" sobbed Meg despairingly.\n\n\"Tell me quick, then. Don't cry, I can bear anything better than that.\nOut with it, love.\"\n\n\"The--the jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!\"\n\nJohn Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward; and the\nderisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which\nput the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.\n\n\"Is that all? Fling it out of window, and don't bother any more about\nit. I'll buy you quarts if you want it; but for heaven's sake don't have\nhysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner, and--\"\n\nJohn got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a\ntragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of mingled\nindignation, reproach, and dismay,--\n\n\"A man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how _could_ you\ndo such a thing?\"\n\n\"Hush, he's in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can't\nbe helped now,\" said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.\n\n\"You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to\nhave remembered how busy I was,\" continued Meg petulantly; for even\nturtle-doves will peck when ruffled.\n\n\"I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for\nI met him on the way out. I never thought of asking leave, when you have\nalways told me to do as I liked. I never tried it before, and hang me if\nI ever do again!\" added John, with an aggrieved air.\n\n\"I should hope not! Take him away at once; I can't see him, and there\nisn't any dinner.\"\n\n\"Well, I like that! Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home, and the\npudding you promised?\" cried John, rushing to the larder.\n\n\"I hadn't time to cook anything; I meant to dine at mother's.

He restrained himself, however, and the little squall would have\nblown over, but for one unlucky word.\n\n\"It's a scrape, I acknowledge; but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull\nthrough, and have a good time yet. Don't cry, dear, but just exert\nyourself a bit, and knock us up something to eat. We're both as hungry\nas hunters, so we sha'n't mind what it is. Give us the cold meat, and\nbread and cheese; we won't ask for jelly.\"\n\nHe meant it for a good-natured joke; but that one word sealed his fate.\nMeg thought it was _too_ cruel to hint about her sad failure, and the\nlast atom of patience vanished as he spoke.\n\n\"You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can; I'm too used up to\n'exert' myself for any one. It's like a man to propose a bone and vulgar\nbread and cheese for company. I won't have anything of the sort in my\nhouse.

Lotty reported that they had eaten \"a\nmuch, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the\nsweet stuff, and hide the pots.\"\n\nMeg longed to go and tell mother; but a sense of shame at her own\nshort-comings, of loyalty to John, \"who might be cruel, but nobody\nshould know it,\" restrained her; and after a summary clearing\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
