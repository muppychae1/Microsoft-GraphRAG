It was not big, nor red, like poor\n\"Petrea's\"; it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world\ncould not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself,\nand it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a\nGrecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.\n\n\"Little Raphael,\" as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for\ndrawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing\nfairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her\nteachers complained that, instead of doing her sums, she covered her\nslate with animals; the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps\non; and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering\nout of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as\nwell as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of\ndeportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being\ngood-tempered, and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.\nHer little airs and graces were much admired, so were her\naccomplishments; for beside her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,\ncrochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two thirds of\nthe words. She had a plaintive way of saying, \"When papa was rich we did\nso-and-so,\" which was very touching; and her long words were considered\n\"perfectly elegant\" by the girls.\n\nAmy was in a fair way to be spoilt; for every one petted her, and her\nsmall vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,\nhowever, rather quenched the vanities; she had to wear her cousin's\nclothes. Now Florence's mamma hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy\nsuffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,\nunbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was\ngood, well made, and little worn; but Amy's artistic eyes were much\nafflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull\npurple, with yellow dots, and no trimming.\n\n\"My only comfort,\" she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, \"is, that\nmother don't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria\nParks' mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful; for sometimes she is\nso bad, her frock is up to her knees, and she can't come to school. When\nI think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my flat\nnose and purple gown, with yellow sky-rockets on it.\"\n\nMeg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and, by some strange attraction of\nopposites, Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her\nthoughts; and over her big, harum-scarum sister, Beth unconsciously\nexercised more influence than any one in the family. The two older girls\nwere a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger into\nher keeping, and watched over her in her own way; \"playing mother\" they\ncalled it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls, with\nthe maternal instinct of little women.\n\n\"Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day I'm\nreally dying for some amusement,\" said Meg, as they sat sewing together\nthat evening.\n\n\"I had a queer time with aunt to-day, and, as I got the best of it, I'll\ntell you about it,\" began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. \"I was\nreading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for\naunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like\nfury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy; and, before she\nbegan to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by\nopening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.\n\n            [Illustration: Reading that everlasting Belsham]\n\n\"'I wish I could, and be done with it,' said I, trying not to be saucy.\n\n\"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and\nthink them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She never\nfinds herself very soon; so the minute her cap began to bob, like a\ntop-heavy dahlia, I whipped the 'Vicar of Wakefield' out of my pocket,\nand read away, with one eye on him, and one on aunt. I'd just got to\nwhere they all tumbled into the water, when I forgot, and laughed out\nloud. Aunt woke up; and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me\nto read a bit, and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy\nand instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though\nshe only said,--\n\n\"'I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it, child.'\n\n\"Back I went, and made the Primros\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a young girl with a talent for drawing and a desire for a Grecian nose)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is Amy's older sister who loves to tell stories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLORENCE<|>PERSON<|>Florence is mentioned as the owner of clothes that Amy has to wear)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARIA PARKS<|>PERSON<|>Maria Parks is mentioned as a classmate of Amy's)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>JO<|>Amy confides in Jo and looks up to her<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>FLORENCE<|>Amy has to wear Florence's clothes, causing her distress<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>MARIA PARKS<|>Amy mentions Maria Parks as an example of a classmate with strict parents<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
