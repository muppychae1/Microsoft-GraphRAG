Happy Amy!\" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as\nProfessor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.\n\nLater in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the\nbootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, who was flitting about,\narranging her new art treasures,--\n\n\"Mrs. Laurence.\"\n\n\"My lord!\"\n\n\"That man intends to marry our Jo!\"\n\n\"I hope so; don't you, dear?\"\n\n\"Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that\nexpressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal\nricher.\"\n\n\"Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love\none another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.\nWomen _never_ should marry for money--\" Amy caught herself up short as\nthe words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with\nmalicious gravity,--\n\n\"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend\nto do it sometimes. If my memory serves me, you once thought it your\nduty to make a rich match; that accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a\ngood-for-nothing like me.\"\n\n\"O my dearest boy, don't, don't say that! I forgot you were rich when I\nsaid 'Yes.' I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I sometimes\nwish you _were_ poor that I might show how much I love you;\" and Amy,\nwho was very dignified in public and very fond in private, gave\nconvincing proofs of the truth of her words.\n\n\"You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be\nonce, do you? It would break my heart if you didn't believe that I'd\ngladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your\nliving by rowing on the lake.\"\n\n\"Am I an idiot and a brute? How could I think so, when you refused a\nricher man for me, and won't let me give you half I want to now, when I\nhave the right? Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to\nthink it is their only salvation; but you had better lessons, and,\nthough I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the\ndaughter was true to the mother's teaching. I told mamma so yesterday,\nand she looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her a check for a\nmillion, to be spent in charity. You are not listening to my moral\nremarks, Mrs. Laurence;\" and Laurie paused, for Amy's eyes had an absent\nlook, though fixed upon his face.\n\n\"Yes, I am, and admiring the dimple in your chin at the same time. I\ndon't wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I'm prouder of my\nhandsome husband than of all his money. Don't laugh, but your nose is\n_such_ a comfort to me;\" and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature\nwith artistic satisfaction.\n\nLaurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that\nsuited him better, as he plainly showed, though he did laugh at his\nwife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly,--\n\n\"May I ask you a question, dear?\"\n\n\"Of course you may.\"\n\n\"Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's the trouble, is it? I thought there was something in the\ndimple that didn't suit you. Not being a dog in the manger, but the\nhappiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo's wedding with a\nheart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my darling?\"\n\nAmy looked up at him, and was satisfied; her last little jealous fear\nvanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and\nconfidence.\n\n\"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn't\nwe invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in\nGermany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?\" said Laurie, when they\nbegan to pace up and down the long drawing-room, arm-in-arm, as they\nwere fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.\n\n             [Illustration: They began to pace up and down]\n\n\"Jo would find us out, and spoil it all; she is very proud of him, just\nas he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful\nthing.\"\n\n\"Bless her dear heart! she won't think so when she has a literary\nhusband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support. We\nwon't interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in\nspite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she\nbelieves in people's paying their honest debts, so I'll get round her in\nthat way.\"\n\n\"How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it? That was\nalways one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely; and, thanks\nto you, the dream has come true.\"\n\n\"Ah! we'll do quantities of good, won't we? There's one sort of poverty\nthat I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of,\nbut poor gentlefolks fare badly, because they won't ask, and people\ndon't dare to offer charity; yet there are a thousand ways of helping\nthem, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR BHAER<|>PERSON<|>Professor Bhaer is a character in the text who opens a gate impatiently)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character in the text who expresses concern about Jo marrying someone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
