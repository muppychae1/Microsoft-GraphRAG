I'm neat and cool and comfortable; quite proper for a dusty\nwalk on a warm day. If people care more for my clothes than they do for\nme, I don't wish to see them. You can dress for both, and be as elegant\nas you please: it pays for you to be fine; it doesn't for me, and\nfurbelows only worry me.\"\n\n\"Oh dear!\" sighed Amy; \"now she's in a contrary fit, and will drive me\ndistracted before I can get her properly ready. I'm sure it's no\npleasure to me to go to-day, but it's a debt we owe society, and there's\nno one to pay it but you and me. I'll do anything for you, Jo, if you'll\nonly dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil. You can\ntalk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and behave so\nbeautifully, if you try, that I'm proud of you. I'm afraid to go alone;\ndo come and take care of me.\"\n\n\"You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old\nsister in that way. The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred, and\nyour being afraid to go anywhere alone! I don't know which is the most\nabsurd. Well, I'll go if I must, and do my best. You shall be commander\nof the expedition, and I'll obey blindly; will that satisfy you?\" said\nJo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamb-like submission.\n\n\"You're a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, and I'll tell\nyou how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good\nimpression. I want people to like you, and they would if you'd only try\nto be a little more agreeable. Do your hair the pretty way, and put the\npink rose in your bonnet; it's becoming, and you look too sober in your\nplain suit. Take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief.\nWe'll stop at Meg's, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can\nhave my dove-colored one.\"\n\nWhile Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them; not\nwithout entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled\ninto her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet\nstrings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she\nput on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out\nthe handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the\npresent mission was to her feelings; and when she had squeezed her hands\ninto tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of\nelegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of countenance,\nsaying meekly,--\n\n\"I'm perfectly miserable; but if you consider me presentable, I die\nhappy.\"\n\n\"You are highly satisfactory; turn slowly round, and let me get a\ncareful view.\" Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then\nfell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously, \"Yes, you'll\ndo; your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet _with_ the rose\nis quite ravishing. Hold back your shoulders, and carry your hands\neasily, no matter if your gloves do pinch. There's one thing you can do\nwell, Jo, that is, wear a shawl--I can't; but it's very nice to see you,\nand I'm so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one; it's simple, but\nhandsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point\nof my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly? I like to\nshow my boots, for my feet _are_ pretty, though my nose isn't.\"\n\n\"You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,\" said Jo, looking through\nher hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the\ngold hair. \"Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it up,\nplease, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house; the sweeping style\nsuits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully. You\nhaven't half buttoned one cuff; do it at once. You'll never look\nfinished if you are not careful about the little details, for they make\nup the pleasing whole.\"\n\nJo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing up\nher cuff; but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as\n\"pretty as picters,\" Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window to\nwatch them.\n\n\"Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so\nI want you to put on your best deportment. Don't make any of your abrupt\nremarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be calm, cool, and\nquiet,--that's safe and ladylike; and you can easily do it for fifteen\nminutes,\" said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed\nthe white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.\n\n\"Let me see. 'Calm, cool, and quiet,'--yes, I think I can promise that.\nI've played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I'll try it\noff.
