It's\ncold and dull out; and I advise you to stay, warm and dry, by the fire,\nas I do,\" said Meg, with a shiver.\n\n\"Never take advice! Can't keep still all day, and, not being a pussycat,\nI don't like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I'm going to\nfind some.\"\n\nMeg went back to toast her feet and read \"Ivanhoe\"; and Jo began to dig\npaths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon\nswept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the sun came\nout; and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the\nMarches' house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the\ncity, which was still country-like, with groves and lawns, large\ngardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one\nside was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of\nthe vines that in summer covered its walls, and the flowers which then\nsurrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly\nbetokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach-house\nand well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely\nthings one caught between the rich curtains. Yet it seemed a lonely,\nlifeless sort of house; for no children frolicked on the lawn, no\nmotherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and\nout, except the old gentleman and his grandson.\n\nTo Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace,\nfull of splendors and delights, which no one enjoyed. She had long\nwanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the \"Laurence boy,\"\nwho looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to\nbegin. Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had\nplanned many ways of making friends with him; but he had not been seen\nlately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a\nbrown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden,\nwhere Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.\n\n\"That boy is suffering for society and fun,\" she said to herself. \"His\ngrandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all\nalone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young\nand lively. I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!\"\n\nThe idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things, and was always\nscandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of \"going over\" was\nnot forgotten; and when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try\nwhat could be done. She saw Mr. Laurence drive off, and then sallied out\nto dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused, and took a survey.\nAll quiet,--curtains down at the lower windows; servants out of sight,\nand nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand\nat the upper window.\n\n\"There he is,\" thought Jo, \"poor boy! all alone and sick this dismal\nday. It's a shame! I'll toss up a snow-ball, and make him look out, and\nthen say a kind word to him.\"\n\nUp went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a\nface which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes\nbrightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and\nflourished her broom as she called out,--\n\n\"How do you do? Are you sick?\"\n\n                [Illustration: Laurie opened the window]\n\nLaurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven,--\n\n\"Better, thank you. I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?\"\n\n\"Nothing; it's as dull as tombs up here.\"\n\n\"Don't you read?\"\n\n\"Not much; they won't let me.\"\n\n\"Can't somebody read to you?\"\n\n\"Grandpa does, sometimes; but my books don't interest him, and I hate to\nask Brooke all the time.\"\n\n\"Have some one come and see you, then.\"\n\n\"There isn't any one I'd like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head\nis weak.\"\n\n\"Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you? Girls are quiet,\nand like to play nurse.\"\n\n\"Don't know any.\"\n\n\"You know us,\" began Jo, then laughed, and stopped.\n\n\"So I do! Will you come, please?\" cried Laurie.\n\n\"I'm not quiet and nice; but I'll come, if mother will let me. I'll go\nask her. Shut that window, like a good boy, and wait\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
