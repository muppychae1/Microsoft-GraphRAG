That same morning, a little girl, in a brown hat and blue\n    dress, with a round face and snub nose, went and bought it for\n    her mother. She lugged it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the\n    big pot; mashed some of it, with salt and butter, for dinner;\n    and to the rest she added a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons\n    of sugar, nutmeg, and some crackers; put it in a deep dish, and\n    baked it till it was brown and nice; and next day it was eaten\n    by a family named March.\n                                                          T.

On rushing, in a body,\n    to the cellar, we discovered our beloved President prostrate\n    upon the floor, having tripped and fallen while getting wood for\n    domestic purposes. A perfect scene of ruin met our eyes; for in\n    his fall Mr. Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a\n    tub of water, upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form, and\n    torn his garments badly.
