She was wrapped up in Beth, and never\nwished to hear the word \"love\" again. Then she begged him to be happy\nwith somebody else, but always to keep a little corner of his heart for\nhis loving sister Jo. In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy\nthat Beth was worse; she was coming home in the spring, and there was no\nneed of saddening the remainder of her stay. That would be time enough,\nplease God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel\nlonely, homesick, or anxious.\n\n\"So I will, at once. Poor little girl; it will be a sad going home for\nher, I'm afraid;\" and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had\nbeen the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks\nbefore.\n\nBut he did not write the letter that day; for, as he rummaged out his\nbest paper, he came across something which changed his purpose. Tumbling\nabout in one part of the desk, among bills, passports, and business\ndocuments of various kinds, were several of Jo's letters, and in another\ncompartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her\nblue ribbons, and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away\ninside. With a half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered\nup all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small\ndrawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his\nfinger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the\ndrawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if\nthere had been a funeral; and, though not overwhelmed with affliction,\nthis seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in\nwriting letters to charming young ladies.\n\n     [Illustration: Turning the ring thoughtfully upon his finger]\n\nThe letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy\n_was_ homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding\nmanner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to and\nfro, with unfailing regularity, all through the early spring. Laurie\nsold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,\nhoping somebody would arrive before long. He wanted desperately to go to\nNice, but would not till he was asked; and Amy would not ask him, for\njust then she was having little experiences of her own, which made her\nrather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of \"our boy.\"\n\nFred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once\ndecided to answer \"Yes, thank you;\" but now she said, \"No, thank you,\"\nkindly but steadily; for, when the time came, her courage failed her,\nand she found that something more than money and position was needed to\nsatisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes\nand fears. The words, \"Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I\nfancied you would ever like,\" and Laurie's face when he uttered them,\nkept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in\nlook, if not in words, \"I shall marry for money.\" It troubled her to\nremember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so\nunwomanly. She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless, worldly\ncreature; she didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as\nshe did to be a lovable woman; she was so glad he didn't hate her for\nthe dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully, and was\nkinder than ever. His letters were such a comfort, for the home letters\nwere very irregular, and were not half so satisfactory as his when they\ndid come. It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them, for the\npoor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted in being\nstony-hearted. She ought to have made an effort, and tried to love him;\nit couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and glad to have\nsuch a dear boy care for them; but Jo never would act like other girls,\nso there was nothing to do but be very kind, and treat him like a\nbrother.\n\nIf all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they\nwould be a much happier race of beings than they are. Amy never lectured\nnow; she asked his opinion on all subjects; she was interested in\neverything he did, made charming little presents for him, and sent him\ntwo letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly confidences, and\ncaptivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her. As few brothers are\ncomplimented by having their letters carried about in their sisters'\npockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when short, kissed when\nlong, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that Amy did any of\nthese fond and foolish things. But she certainly did grow a little pale\nand pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society, and went\nout sketching alone a good deal. She never had much to show when she\ncame home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while she sat for hours,\nwith her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched\nany\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
