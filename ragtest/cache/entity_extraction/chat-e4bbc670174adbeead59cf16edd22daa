She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her\nduty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust\nthat her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life\nget harder and harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all\nsunshine, and some all shadow; it was not fair, for she tried more than\nAmy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble,\nand hard work.\n\nPoor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came\nover her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,\ndevoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never\nseemed to grow any easier. \"I can't do it. I wasn't meant for a life\nlike this, and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if\nsomebody don't come and help me,\" she said to herself, when her first\nefforts failed, and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind\nwhich often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.\n\nBut some one did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good\nangels at once, because they wore familiar shapes, and used the simple\nspells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started up at night,\nthinking Beth called her; and when the sight of the little empty bed\nmade her cry with the bitter cry of an unsubmissive sorrow, \"O Beth,\ncome back! come back!\" she did not stretch out her yearning arms in\nvain; for, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her\nsister's faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with\nwords only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears\nthat were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken\nwhispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went\nhand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to\nheart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,\nwhich chastened grief and strengthened love. Feeling this, Jo's burden\nseemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more\nendurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother's arms.\n\nWhen aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found\nhelp; for one day she went to the study, and, leaning over the good gray\nhead lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said, very\nhumbly,--\n\n\"Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it more than she did, for\nI'm all wrong.\"\n\n\"My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,\" he answered, with a falter\nin his voice, and both arms round her, as if he, too, needed help, and\ndid not fear to ask it.\n\n                   [Illustration: Jo and her father]\n\nThen, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told her\ntroubles,--the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that\ndiscouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all\nthe sad bewilderment which we call despair. She gave him entire\nconfidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation\nin the act; for the time had come when they could talk together not only\nas father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to serve\neach other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. Happy,\nthoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called \"the church of\none member,\" and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered\ncheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit; for the parents who had\ntaught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach\nanother to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its\nbeautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.\n\nOther helps had Jo,--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would\nnot be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned to\nsee and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as\nthey once had been, for Beth had presided over both; and something of\nher housewifely spirit seemed to linger round the little mop and the old\nbrush, that was never thrown away. As she used them, Jo found herself\nhumming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and\ngiving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and\ncosey, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she\ndidn't know it, till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the\nhand,--\n\n\"You thoughtful creter, you're determined we sha'n't miss that dear lamb\nef you can help it. We don't say much, but we see it, and the Lord will\nbless you for't, see ef He don't.\"\n\nAs they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister\nMeg was; how well she could talk, how much she knew about good, womanly\nimpulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and\nchildren, and how much they were all doing for each other.\n\n\"Marriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I should blossom\nout half as well as you have, if I tried it?\" said Jo, as she\nconstructed a kite for Demi\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
