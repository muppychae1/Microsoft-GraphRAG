With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off,\nMeg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten\nboats, safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave\nBeth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to look at,\ntouch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered\ntreasure.\n\nLaurie, meanwhile, posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well\nthat Aunt March actually \"sniffed\" herself, and never once said, \"I told\nyou so.\" Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good\nthoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried her\ntears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never\neven thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in\nLaurie's opinion, that she behaved \"like a capital little woman.\" Even\nPolly seemed impressed, for he called her \"good girl,\" blessed her\nbuttons, and begged her to \"come and take a walk, dear,\" in his most\naffable tone. She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright\nwintry weather; but, discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in\nspite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest\non the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time\nabout it; and, when she returned, he was stretched out, with both arms\nunder his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the\ncurtains, and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.\n\nAfter a while, they began to think he was not going to wake till night,\nand I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by\nAmy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a good\nmany happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my\nprivate opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her\nmother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation\nin the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone\ntogether in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its\npurpose was explained to her.\n\n\"On the contrary, I like it very much, dear,\" looking from the dusty\nrosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its\ngarland of evergreen. \"It is an excellent plan to have some place where\nwe can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. There are a good\nmany hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we\nask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning this?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother; and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big\ncloset to put my books, and the copy of that picture which I've tried to\nmake. The woman's face is not good,--it's too beautiful for me to\ndraw,--but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to\nthink He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and\nthat helps me.\"\n\nAs Amy pointed to the smiling Christ-child on his mother's knee, Mrs.\nMarch saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. She said\nnothing, but Amy understood the look, and, after a minute's pause, she\nadded gravely,--\n\n\"I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it. Aunt gave me the\nring to-day; she called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my\nfinger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me\nalways. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it's too\nbig. I'd like to wear them, mother; can I?\"\n\n\"They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such\nornaments, Amy,\" said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand, with\nthe band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint guard,\nformed of two tiny, golden hands clasped together.\n\n\"I'll try not to be vain,\" said Amy. \"I don't think I like it only\nbecause it's so pretty; but I want to wear it as the girl in the story\nwore her bracelet, to remind me of something.\"\n\n\"Do you mean Aunt March?\" asked her mother, laughing.\n\n\"No, to remind me not to be selfish.\" Amy looked so earnest and sincere\nabout it, that her mother stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to\nthe little plan.\n\n\"I've thought a great deal lately about my 'bundle of naughties,' and\nbeing selfish is the largest one in it; so I'm going to try hard to cure\nit, if I can. Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason every one loves\nher and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People wouldn't feel\nhalf so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character who comforts others and tells stories well)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Aunt March is a character who shows approval and affection towards others)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a character who receives consolation and compensation from her mother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLLY<|>PERSON<|>Polly is a character who shows kindness and affability towards others)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
