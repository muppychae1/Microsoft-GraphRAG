It's strong and neat, so I ought not to complain,\nbut I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one with a\ngold top,\" sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great\ndisfavor.\n\n\"Change it,\" advised Jo.\n\n\"I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took so much\npains to get my things. It's a nonsensical notion of mine, and I'm not\ngoing to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves\nare my comfort. You are a dear, to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich,\nand sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for\ncommon;\" and Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove-box.\n\n\"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her night-caps; would you put\nsome on mine?\" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,\nfresh from Hannah's hands.\n\n\"No, I wouldn't; for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns, without\nany trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn't rig,\" said Jo decidedly.\n\n\"I wonder if I shall _ever_ be happy enough to have real lace on my\nclothes, and bows on my caps?\" said Meg impatiently.\n\n\"You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you could only\ngo to Annie Moffat's,\" observed Beth, in her quiet way.\n\n\"So I did! Well, I _am_ happy, and I _won't_ fret; but it does seem as\nif the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it? There, now, the\ntrays are ready, and everything in but my ball-dress, which I shall\nleave for mother to pack,\" said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from\nthe half-filled trunk to the many-times pressed and mended white\ntarlatan, which she called her \"ball-dress,\" with an important air.\n\nThe next day was fine, and Meg departed, in style, for a fortnight of\nnovelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather\nreluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented\nthan she went. But she had begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to\ntake good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after\na winter of irksome work, that the mother yielded, and the daughter went\nto take her first taste of fashionable life.\n\nThe Moffats _were_ very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,\nat first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its\noccupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life\nthey led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,\nwithout understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or\nintelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal\nthe ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was\nagreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best\nfrock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her\nexactly; and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of\nthose about her; to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,\ncrimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well\nas she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the more\nshe envied her, and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal\nas she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she\nwas a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves\nand silk stockings.\n\nShe had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls\nwere busily employed in \"having a good time.\" They shopped, walked,\nrode, and called all day; went to theatres and operas, or frolicked at\nhome in the evening; for Annie had many friends, and knew how to\nentertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one\nwas engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.\nMr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father; and Mrs.\nMoffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her\ndaughter had done. Every one petted her; and \"Daisy,\" as they called\nher, was in a fair way to have her head turned.\n\nWhen the evening for the \"small party\" came, she found that the poplin\nwouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses,\nand making themselves very fine indeed; so out came the tarlatan,\nlooking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new\none. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her\ncheeks began to burn, for, with all her gentleness, she was very proud.\nNo one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and\nAnnie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white\narms; but in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her\nheart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed,\nchattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
