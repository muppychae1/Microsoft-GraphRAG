I'm going to laugh, and I shall drop 'em.\"\n\nJohn rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm,\nas if already initiated into the mysteries of baby-tending, while Laurie\nlaughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.\n\n\"It's the best joke of the season, isn't it? I wouldn't have you told,\nfor I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I've done\nit,\" said Jo, when she got her breath.\n\n\"I never was more staggered in my life. Isn't it fun? Are they boys?\nWhat are you going to name them? Let's have another look. Hold me up,\nJo; for upon my life it's one too many for me,\" returned Laurie,\nregarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland\nlooking at a pair of infantile kittens.\n\n\"Boy and girl. Aren't they beauties?\" said the proud papa, beaming upon\nthe little, red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.\n\n\"Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which?\" and Laurie bent\nlike a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.\n\n\"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French\nfashion, so you can always tell. Besides, one has blue eyes and one\nbrown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,\" said wicked Jo.\n\n\"I'm afraid they mightn't like it,\" began Laurie, with unusual timidity\nin such matters.\n\n\"Of course they will; they are used to it now. Do it this minute, sir!\"\ncommanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.\n\nLaurie screwed up his face, and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each\nlittle cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.\n\n\"There, I knew they didn't like it! That's the boy; see him kick; he\nhits out with his fists like a good one. Now then, young Brooke, pitch\ninto a man of your own size, will you?\" cried Laurie, delighted with a\npoke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.\n\n\"He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother and\ngrandmother. We shall call her Daisy, so as not to have two Megs, and I\nsuppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name,\" said\nAmy, with aunt-like interest.\n\n\"Name him Demijohn, and call him 'Demi' for short,\" said Laurie.\n\n\"Daisy and Demi,--just the thing! I _knew_ Teddy would do it,\" cried Jo,\nclapping her hands.\n\nTeddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were \"Daisy\" and\n\"Demi\" to the end of the chapter.\n\n\n\n\n                                 XXIX.\n\n                                 CALLS.\n\n\n                         [Illustration: Calls]\n\n\"Come, Jo, it's time.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half\na dozen calls with me to-day?\"\n\n\"I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don't\nthink I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls in one day, when a\nsingle one upsets me for a week.\"\n\n\"Yes, you did; it was a bargain between us. I was to finish the crayon\nof Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and return our\nneighbors' visits.\"\n\n\"If it was fair--that was in the bond; and I stand to the letter of my\nbond, Shylock. There is a pile of clouds in the east; it's _not_ fair,\nand I don't go.\"\n\n\"Now, that's shirking. It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you\npride yourself on keeping promises; so be honorable; come and do your\nduty, and then be at peace for another six months.\"\n\nAt that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking; for she was\nmantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself\nbecause she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking\nto be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make\ncalls in her best array, on a warm July day. She hated calls of the\nformal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain,\nbribe, or promise. In the present instance, there was no escape; and\nhaving clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she\nsmelt thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat and\ngloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.\n\n\"Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You don't intend\nto make calls in that state, I hope,\" cried Amy, surveying her with\namazement.\n\n\"Why not? I'm neat and cool and comfortable; quite proper for a dusty\nwalk on a warm day. If people care more for my clothes than they do for\nme, I don't wish to see them. You can dress for both, and be as elegant\nas you please: it pays for you to be fine; it doesn't for me, and\nfurbelows only worry me.\"\n\n\"Oh dear!\" sighed Amy; \"now she's in a contrary fit, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
