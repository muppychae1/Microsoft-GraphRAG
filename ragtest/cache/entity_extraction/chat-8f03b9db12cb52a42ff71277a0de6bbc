The sound of\nvoices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour; but what happened\nduring that interview the girls never knew.\n\nWhen they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother, with such\na penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it\nwise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble apology, and was much\ncomforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.\n\n\"I'll never tell him to my dying day,--wild horses sha'n't drag it out\nof me; so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show how\nout-and-out sorry I am,\" he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.\n\n\"I'll try; but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do. I didn't think\nyou could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,\" replied Meg, trying to hide\nher maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.\n\n\"It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for a\nmonth; but you will, though, won't you?\" and Laurie folded his hands\ntogether with such an imploring gesture, as he spoke in his irresistibly\npersuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him, in spite of\nhis scandalous behavior. Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face\nrelaxed, in spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him\ndeclare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and\nabase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.\n\nJo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and\nsucceeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire\ndisapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but, as she showed\nno sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till\nthe others were done with him, when he made her a low bow, and walked\noff without a word.\n\nAs soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving; and when\nMeg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely, and longed for Teddy.\nAfter resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and, armed\nwith a book to return, went over to the big house.\n\n\"Is Mr. Laurence in?\" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming down\nstairs.\n\n\"Yes, miss; but I don't believe he's seeable just yet.\"\n\n\"Why not? is he ill?\"\n\n\"La, no, miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of\nhis tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I\ndursn't go nigh him.\"\n\n\"Where is Laurie?\"\n\n\"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been a-tapping. I\ndon't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's ready, and there's\nno one to eat it.\"\n\n\"I'll go and see what the matter is. I'm not afraid of either of them.\"\n\nUp went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.\n\n\"Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!\" called out the young\ngentleman, in a threatening tone.\n\nJo immediately knocked again; the door flew open, and in she bounced,\nbefore Laurie could recover from his surprise. Seeing that he really\n_was_ out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite\nexpression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly,\n\"Please forgive me for being so cross. I came to make it up, and can't\ngo away till I have.\"\n\n\"It's all right. Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo,\" was the cavalier\nreply to her petition.\n\n              [Illustration: Get up and don't be a goose]\n\n\"Thank you; I will. Could I ask what's the matter? You don't look\nexactly easy in your mind.\"\n\n\"I've been shaken, and I won't bear it!\" growled Laurie indignantly.\n\n\"Who did it?\" demanded Jo.\n\n\"Grandfather; if it had been any one else I'd have--\" and the injured\nyouth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.\n\n\"That's nothing; I often shake you, and you don't mind,\" said Jo\nsoothingly.\n\n\"Pooh! you're a girl, and it's fun; but I'll allow no man to shake\n_me_.\"\n\n\"I don't think any one would care to try it, if you looked as much like\na thunder-cloud as you do now. Why were you treated so?\"\n\n\"Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd\npromised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my word.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?\"\n\n\"No; he _would_ have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\ntruth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing\nMeg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the\nold gentleman collared me. Then I got angry, and bolted, for fear I\nshould forget myself.\"\n\n\"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know; so go down and make up\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
