Sleep forsook her eyes, meals stood\nuntasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which\nblessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth living, even\nif they bore no other fruit. The divine afflatus usually lasted a week\nor two, and then she emerged from her \"vortex,\" hungry, sleepy, cross,\nor despondent.\n\nShe was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed\nupon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for her virtue\nwas rewarded with a new idea. It was a People's Course, the lecture on\nthe Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for\nsuch an audience, but took it for granted that some great social evil\nwould be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories\nof the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price\nof coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder\nriddles than that of the Sphinx.\n\nThey were early; and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking, Jo\namused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the\nseat with them. On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads,\nand bonnets to match, discussing Woman's Rights and making tatting.\nBeyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the\nhand, a sombre spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an\nold gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On\nher right, her only neighbor was a studious-looking lad absorbed in a\nnewspaper.\n\nIt was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,\nidly wondering what unfortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed\nthe melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume, tumbling\nover a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young\ngentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each\nother close by, and a dishevelled female was flying away in the\nbackground with her mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a page, the lad saw\nher looking, and, with boyish good-nature, offered half his paper,\nsaying bluntly, \"Want to read it? That's a first-rate story.\"\n\nJo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for\nlads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,\nmystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light\nliterature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author's\ninvention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the\n_dramatis personæ_, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.\n\n\"Prime, isn't it?\" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last\nparagraph of her portion.\n\n\"I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,\" returned Jo,\namused at his admiration of the trash.\n\n\"I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good\nliving out of such stories, they say;\" and he pointed to the name of\nMrs. S. L. A. N. G. Northbury, under the title of the tale.\n\n\"Do you know her?\" asked Jo, with sudden interest.\n\n\"No; but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the\noffice where this paper is printed.\"\n\n\"Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?\" and Jo\nlooked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly-sprinkled\nexclamation-points that adorned the page.\n\n\"Guess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well for\nwriting it.\"\n\nHere the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while Prof.\nSands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and\nhieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,\nand boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its\ncolumns for a sensational story. By the time the lecture ended and the\naudience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not the\nfirst founded upon paper), and was already deep in the concoction of her\nstory, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the\nelopement or after the murder.\n\nShe said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much to\nthe disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when\n\"genius took to burning.\" Jo had never tried this style before,\ncontenting herself with very mild romances for the \"Spread Eagle.\" Her\ntheatrical experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for\nthey gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language,\nand costumes. Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her\nlimited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to\nmake it, and, having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an\nearthquake, as\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a creative individual who enjoys writing and gets lost in her imagination)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISS CROCKER<|>PERSON<|>Miss Crocker is an acquaintance of Jo who Jo escorts to a lecture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROF.
