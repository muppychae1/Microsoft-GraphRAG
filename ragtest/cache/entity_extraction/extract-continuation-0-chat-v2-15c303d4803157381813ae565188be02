He says he feels as if he 'could make a prosperous voyage now\nwith me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast.' I pray he may,\nand try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain with all\nmy heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while God lets\nus be together. O mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world\ncould be, when two people love and live for one another!\"\n\n\"And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love does work\nmiracles. How very, very happy they must be!\" And Jo laid the rustling\nsheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a\nlovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he\nfinds himself alone in the work-a-day world again.\n\nBy and by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not\nwalk. A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again,\nnot bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one\nsister should have all she asked, the other nothing. It was not true;\nshe knew that, and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for\naffection was strong, and Amy's happiness woke the hungry longing for\nsome one to \"love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them\nbe together.\"\n\nUp in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended, stood four little\nwooden chests in a row, each marked with its owner's name, and each\nfilled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all. Jo\nglanced into them, and when she came to her own, leaned her chin on the\nedge, and stared absently at the chaotic collection, till a bundle of\nold exercise-books caught her eye. She drew them out, turned them over,\nand re-lived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke's. She had smiled\nat first, then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a\nlittle message written in the Professor's hand, her lips began to\ntremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking at the\nfriendly words, as if they took a new meaning, and touched a tender spot\nin her heart.\n\n\"Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely\ncome.\"\n\n\"Oh, if he only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me always; my\ndear old Fritz, I didn't value him half enough when I had him, but now\nhow I should love to see him, for every one seems going away from me,\nand I'm all alone.\"\n\nAnd holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be\nfulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag-bag, and cried, as\nif in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.\n\n  [Illustration: Jo laid her head on a comfortable rag-bag and cried]\n\nWas it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits? or was it the waking\nup of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer?\nWho shall say?\n\n\n\n\n     [Illustration: A substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her]\n\n                                 XLIII.\n\n                               SURPRISES.\n\n\nJo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the\nfire, and thinking. It was her favorite way of spending the hour of\ndusk; no one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little\nred pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender\nthoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. Her face looked tired,\ngrave, and rather sad; for to-morrow was her birthday, and she was\nthinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and how\nlittle she seemed to have accomplished. Almost twenty-five, and nothing\nto show for it. Jo was mistaken in that; there was a good deal to show,\nand by and by she saw, and was grateful for it.\n\n\"An old maid, that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for\na spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a\nmorsel of fame, perhaps; when, like poor Johnson, I'm old, and can't\nenjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it.\nWell, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner; and, I dare say,\nold maids are very comfortable when they get used to it; but--\" and\nthere Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.\n\nIt seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to\nfive-and-twenty; but it's not so bad as it looks, and one can get on\nquite happily if one has something in one's self to fall back upon. At\ntwenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly\nresolve that they never will be; at thirty they say nothing about it,\nbut quietly accept the fact, and, if sensible, console themselves by\nremembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which\nthey may be learning to grow old gracefully. Don't laugh at the\nspinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragical romances are\nhidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober g\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a character who is experiencing happiness in love)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character who is feeling a mix of emotions, including loneliness and longing for affection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
