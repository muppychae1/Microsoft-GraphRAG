The second year began\nrather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March\ndied suddenly. But when their first sorrow was over,--for they loved the\nold lady in spite of her sharp tongue,--they found they had cause for\nrejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of\njoyful things possible.\n\n\"It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum; for of course you\nintend to sell it,\" said Laurie, as they were all talking the matter\nover, some weeks later.\n\n\"No, I don't,\" was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle,\nwhom she had adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.\n\n\"You don't mean to live there?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power of\nmoney to keep it in order. The garden and orchard alone need two or\nthree men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it.\"\n\n\"He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it.\"\n\n\"And you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, that sounds\nparadisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work.\"\n\n\"The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one;\" and Jo laughed.\n\n\"Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Boys. I want to open a school for little lads,--a good, happy, homelike\nschool, with me to take care of them, and Fritz to teach them.\"\n\n\"There's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her?\" cried\nLaurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.\n\n\"I like it,\" said Mrs. March decidedly.\n\n\"So do I,\" added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for\ntrying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.\n\n\"It will be an immense care for Jo,\" said Meg, stroking the head of her\none all-absorbing son.\n\n\"Jo can do it, and be happy in it. It's a splendid idea. Tell us all\nabout it,\" cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers a\nhand, but knew that they would refuse his help.\n\n\"I knew you'd stand by me, sir. Amy does too--I see it in her eyes,\nthough she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she\nspeaks. Now, my dear people,\" continued Jo earnestly, \"just understand\nthat this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long-cherished plan. Before my\nFritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my fortune, and no one\nneeded me at home, I'd hire a big house, and pick up some poor, forlorn\nlittle lads, who hadn't any mothers, and take care of them, and make\nlife jolly for them before it was too late. I see so many going to ruin,\nfor want of help at the right minute; I love so to do anything for them;\nI seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and, oh,\nI should _so_ like to be a mother to them!\"\n\nMrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in\nher eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not\nseen for a long while.\n\n\"I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would\nlike, and agreed to try it when we got rich. Bless his dear heart, he's\nbeen doing it all his life,--helping poor boys, I mean, not getting\nrich; that he'll never be; money doesn't stay in his pocket long enough\nto lay up any. But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved me better\nthan I ever deserved, _I'm_ rich, at least I feel so, and we can live at\nPlumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school. It's just the\nplace for boys, the house is big, and the furniture strong and plain.\nThere's plenty of room for dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside.\nThey could help in the garden and orchard: such work is healthy, isn't\nit, sir? Then Fritz can train and teach in his own way, and father will\nhelp him. I can feed and nurse and pet and scold them; and mother will\nbe my stand-by. I've always longed for lots of boys, and never had\nenough; now I can fill the house full, and revel in the little dears to\nmy heart's content. Think what luxury,--Plumfield my own, and a\nwilderness of boys to enjoy it with me!\"\n\nAs Jo waved her hands, and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off\ninto a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought\nhe'd have an apoplectic fit.\n\n\"I don't see anything funny,\" she said gravely, when she could be heard.\n\"Nothing could be more natural or\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PLUMFIELD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plumfield is a school for little lads run by Jo and Fritz)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is the founder of Plumfield and wants to take care of and educate poor boys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRITZ<|>PERSON<|>Fritz is Jo's partner in running Plumfield and has been helping poor boys all his life)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Aunt March left Plumfield to Jo in her will)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a friend of Jo and supports her plan for Plumfield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
