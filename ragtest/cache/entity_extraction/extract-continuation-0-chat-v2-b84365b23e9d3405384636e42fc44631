Didn't you take your story out of 'The Sea-Lion?'\" said Laurie.\n\n\"Rather.\"\n\n\"Don't you think the English nation perfect in every respect?\" asked\nSallie.\n\n\"I should be ashamed of myself if I didn't.\"\n\n\"He's a true John Bull. Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance\nwithout waiting to draw. I'll harrow up your feelings first, by asking\nif you don't think you are something of a flirt,\" said Laurie, as Jo\nnodded to Fred, as a sign that peace was declared.\n\n\"You impertinent boy! of course I'm not,\" exclaimed Sallie, with an air\nthat proved the contrary.\n\n\"What do you hate most?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"Spiders and rice-pudding.\"\n\n\"What do you like best?\" asked Jo.\n\n\"Dancing and French gloves.\"\n\n\"Well, _I_ think Truth is a very silly play; let's have a sensible game\nof Authors, to refresh our minds,\" proposed Jo.\n\nNed, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and, while it went on,\nthe three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took out her sketch\nagain, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass, with\na book, which he did not read.\n\n\"How beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw,\" said Meg, with mingled\nadmiration and regret in her voice.\n\n\"Why don't you learn? I should think you had taste and talent for it,\"\nreplied Miss Kate graciously.\n\n\"I haven't time.\"\n\n\"Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy. So did mine; but I\nproved to her that I had talent, by taking a few lessons privately, and\nthen she was quite willing I should go on. Can't you do the same with\nyour governess?\"\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\n\"I forgot; young ladies in America go to school more than with us. Very\nfine schools they are, too, papa says. You go to a private one, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"I don't go at all; I am a governess myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Miss Kate; but she might as well have said, \"Dear me,\nhow dreadful!\" for her tone implied it, and something in her face made\nMeg color, and wish she had not been so frank.\n\nMr. Brooke looked up, and said quickly, \"Young ladies in America love\nindependence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired and\nrespected for supporting themselves.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; of course it's very nice and proper in them to do so. We have\nmany most respectable and worthy young women, who do the same and are\nemployed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of gentlemen,\nthey are both well-bred and accomplished, you know,\" said Miss Kate, in\na patronizing tone, that hurt Meg's pride, and made her work seem not\nonly more distasteful, but degrading.\n\n\"Did the German song suit, Miss March?\" inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking an\nawkward pause.\n\n\"Oh, yes! it was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever translated\nit for me;\" and Meg's downcast face brightened as she spoke.\n\n\"Don't you read German?\" asked Miss Kate, with a look of surprise.\n\n\"Not very well. My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't get on\nvery fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation.\"\n\n\"Try a little now; here is Schiller's 'Mary Stuart,' and a tutor who\nloves to teach,\" and Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap, with an\ninviting smile.\n\n\"It's so hard I'm afraid to try,\" said Meg, grateful, but bashful in the\npresence of the accomplished young lady beside her.\n\n\"I'll read a bit to encourage you;\" and Miss Kate read one of the most\nbeautiful passages, in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless\nmanner.\n\nMr. Brooke made no comment, as she returned the book to Meg, who said\ninnocently,--\n\n\"I thought it was poetry.\"\n\n\"Some of it is. Try this passage.\"\n\nThere was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he opened at poor\nMary's lament.\n\nMeg, obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used\nto point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of\nthe hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice. Down the\npage went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in the\nbeauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little touch of\ntragedy to the words of the unhappy queen. If she had seen the brown\neyes then, she would have stopped short; but she never looked up, and\nthe lesson was not spoiled for her.\n\n\"Very well indeed!\" said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her\nmany mistakes, and looking as if he did, indeed, \"love to teach.\"\n\nMiss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little\ntableau before her, shut her sketch-book, saying, with condescension,--\n\n               [Illustration: Miss Kate put up her glass]\n\n\"You've a nice accent, and, in time, will be a clever reader.
