The other gentlemen\nspeculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and\nwandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted\nfans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.\n\nAunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said\nsomething to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam\nwith satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and\nanxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till\nseveral days later.\n\nThe fair was pronounced a success; and when May bade Amy good night, she\ndid not \"gush\" as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look\nwhich said, \"Forgive and forget.\" That satisfied Amy; and when she got\nhome she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney-piece, with a\ngreat bouquet in each. \"The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,\" as\nLaurie announced with a flourish.\n\n\"You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character\nthan I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You've behaved sweetly, and I\nrespect you with all my heart,\" said Jo warmly, as they brushed their\nhair together late that night.\n\n\"Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. It must\nhave been dreadfully hard, after working so long, and setting your heart\non selling your own pretty things. I don't believe I could have done it\nas kindly as you did,\" added Beth from her pillow.\n\n\"Why, girls, you needn't praise me so; I only did as I'd be done by. You\nlaugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true\ngentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know\nhow. I can't explain exactly, but I want to be above the little\nmeannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women. I'm far from\nit now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what mother is.\"\n\nAmy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug,--\n\n\"I understand now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You\nare getting on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in\ntrue politeness, for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away,\ndeary; you'll get your reward some day, and no one will be more\ndelighted than I shall.\"\n\nA week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be\ndelighted. A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's face was\nilluminated to such a degree, when she read it, that Jo and Beth, who\nwere with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.\n\n\"Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants--\"\n\n\"Me to go with her!\" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an\nuncontrollable rapture.\n\n\"No, dear, not you; it's Amy.\"\n\n\"O mother! she's too young; it's my turn first.
