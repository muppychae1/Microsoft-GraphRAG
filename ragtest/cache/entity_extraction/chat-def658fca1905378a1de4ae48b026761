That is the secret of our home\nhappiness: he does not let business wean him from the little cares and\nduties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic worries destroy\nmy interest in his pursuits. Each do our part alone in many things, but\nat home we work together, always.\"\n\n\"It is so, mother; and my great wish is to be to my husband and children\nwhat you have been to yours. Show me how; I'll do anything you say.\"\n\n\"You always were my docile daughter. Well, dear, if I were you, I'd let\nJohn have more to do with the management of Demi, for the boy needs\ntraining, and it's none too soon to begin. Then I'd do what I have often\nproposed, let Hannah come and help you; she is a capital nurse, and you\nmay trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework. You\nneed the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and John would find his\nwife again. Go out more; keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the\nsunshine-maker of the family, and if you get dismal there is no fair\nweather. Then I'd try to take an interest in whatever John likes,--talk\nwith him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in\nthat way. Don't shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman,\nbut understand what is going on, and educate yourself to take your part\nin the world's work, for it all affects you and yours.\"\n\n\"John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid if I ask\nquestions about politics and things.\"\n\n\"I don't believe he would; love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom\ncould you ask more freely than of him? Try it, and see if he doesn't\nfind your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's suppers.\"\n\n\"I will. Poor John! I'm afraid I _have_ neglected him sadly, but I\nthought I was right, and he never said anything.\"\n\n\"He tried not to be selfish, but he _has_ felt rather forlorn, I fancy.\nThis is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow\napart, and the very time when they ought to be most together; for the\nfirst tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it;\nand no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years\nof the little lives given them to train. Don't let John be a stranger to\nthe babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this\nworld of trial and temptation than anything else, and through them you\nwill learn to know and love one another as you should. Now, dear,\ngood-by; think over mother's preachment, act upon it if it seems good,\nand God bless you all!\"\n\nMeg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the\nfirst attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. Of course\nthe children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as they\nfound out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted.\nMamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but papa was not so easily\nsubjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt\nat paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a\ntrifle of his sire's firmness of character,--we won't call it\nobstinacy,--and when he made up his little mind to have or to do\nanything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change\nthat pertinacious little mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be\ntaught to conquer his prejudices, but papa believed that it never was\ntoo soon to learn obedience; so Master Demi early discovered that when\nhe undertook to \"wrastle\" with \"parpar,\" he always got the worst of it;\nyet, like the Englishman, Baby respected the man who conquered him, and\nloved the father whose grave \"No, no,\" was more impressive than all\nmamma's love-pats.\n\nA few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social\nevening with John; so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in\norder, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early, that\nnothing should interfere with her experiment. But, unfortunately, Demi's\nmost unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that night he\ndecided to go on a rampage; so poor Meg sung and rocked, told stories\nand tried every sleep-provoking wile she could devise, but all in vain,\nthe big eyes wouldn't shut; and long after Daisy had gone to byelow,\nlike the chubby little bunch of good-nature she was, naughty Demi lay\nstaring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression\nof countenance.\n\n\"Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while mamma runs down and gives\npoor papa his tea?\" asked Meg, as the hall-door softly closed, and the\nwell-known step went tiptoeing into the dining-room.\n\n\"Me has tea!\" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.\n\n\"No; but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you'll go\nbye-by like Daisy. Will you, lovey?\"\n\n\"Iss!\" and Dem\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
