As she sat with the paper folded between her hands, the\ncharred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived the blaze, and crept to\nthe bedside, hoping Beth slept.\n\n\"Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it; I knew\nyou wouldn't care. Have I been all that to you, Jo?\" she asked, with\nwistful, humble earnestness.\n\n\"O Beth, so much, so much!\" and Jo's head went down upon the pillow,\nbeside her sister's.\n\n\"Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life. I'm not so good as you make\nme, but I _have_ tried to do right; and now, when it's too late to\nbegin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that some one loves\nme so much, and feels as if I'd helped them.\"\n\n\"More than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I couldn't let\nyou go; but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose you; that you'll be\nmore to me than ever, and death can't part us, though it seems to.\"\n\n\"I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm sure I shall\nbe your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever. You must take\nmy place, Jo, and be everything to father and mother when I'm gone. They\nwill turn to you, don't fail them; and if it's hard to work alone,\nremember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing\nthat than writing splendid books or seeing all the world; for love is\nthe only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the\nend so easy.\"\n\n\"I'll try, Beth;\" and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,\npledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of\nother desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the\nimmortality of love.\n\nSo the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth\ngreener, the flowers were up fair and early, and the birds came back in\ntime to say good-by to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child, clung\nto the hands that had led her all her life, as father and mother guided\nher tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up to God.\n\nSeldom, except in books, do the dying utter memorable words, see\nvisions, or depart with beatified countenances; and those who have sped\nmany parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and\nsimply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the \"tide went out easily;\" and in\nthe dark hour before the dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her\nfirst breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving\nlook, one little sigh.\n\nWith tears and prayers and tender hands, mother and sisters made her\nready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with\ngrateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic\npatience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling, with reverent\njoy, that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom\nfull of dread.\n\nWhen morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,\nJo's place was empty, and the room was very still. But a bird sang\nblithely on a budding bough, close by, the snow-drops blossomed freshly\nat the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction\nover the placid face upon the pillow,--a face so full of painless peace\nthat those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked God\nthat Beth was well at last.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                [Illustration: Sat staring up at the busts]\n\n                                  XLI.\n\n                          LEARNING TO FORGET.\n\n\nAmy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it till\nlong afterward; men seldom do, for when women are the advisers, the\nlords of creation don't take the advice till they have persuaded\nthemselves that it is just what they intended to do; then they act upon\nit, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the credit of\nit; if it fails, they generously give her the whole. Laurie went back to\nhis grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the\nold gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully,\nand he had better try it again. There was nothing the young gentleman\nwould have liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back\nafter the scolding he had received; pride forbid, and whenever the\nlonging grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating the\nwords that had made the deepest impression, \"I despise you;\" \"Go and do\nsomething splendid that will _make\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is a beloved sister who is dying and imparting wisdom to her sister Jo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is Beth's sister who is receiving wisdom and guidance from Beth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER<|>PERSON<|>Mother of Beth and Jo, preparing Beth for her final rest)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SISTERS<|>PERSON<|>Sisters of Beth and Jo, assisting in preparing Beth for her final rest)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOD<|>PERSON<|>Belief in God and the afterlife providing comfort to Beth and her family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALLEY OF THE SHADOW<|>GEO<|>Metaphorical representation of the journey towards death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRING DAYS<|>EVENT<|>Symbolic representation of the passage of time and renewal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAWN<|>EVENT<|>Symbolic representation of a new beginning after death)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>JO<|>Beth imparts wisdom and guidance to Jo before her death<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>MOTHER<|>Mother and sisters prepare Beth for her final rest<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>GOD<|>Belief in God and the afterlife provides comfort to Beth<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>VALLEY OF THE SHADOW<|>Metaphorical representation of the journey towards death experienced by Beth<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>SPRING DAYS<|>Symbolic representation of the passage of time and renewal experienced by Beth<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>DAWN<|>Symbolic representation of a new beginning after death for Beth<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>MOTHER<|>Mother and sisters assist in preparing Beth for her final rest<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>SISTERS<|>Sisters assist in preparing Beth for her final rest<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>GOD<|>Belief in God and the afterlife provides comfort to Jo<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>VALLEY OF THE SHADOW<|>Metaphorical representation of the journey towards death experienced by Jo<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>SPRING DAYS<|>Symbolic representation of the passage of time and renewal experienced by Jo<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>DAWN<|>Symbolic representation of a new beginning after death for Jo<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
