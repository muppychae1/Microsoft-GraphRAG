Her sisters braided up her\npretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the\nvalley, which \"her John\" liked best of all the flowers that grew.\n\n\"You _do_ look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely\nthat I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,\" cried Amy,\nsurveying her with delight, when all was done.\n\n\"Then I am satisfied. But please hug and kiss me, every one, and don't\nmind my dress; I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it\nto-day;\" and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her\nwith April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not changed\nthe old.\n\n\"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a few\nminutes with father quietly in the study;\" and Meg ran down to perform\nthese little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she\nwent, conscious that, in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there\nwas a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first\nbird from the nest.\n\nAs the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their\nsimple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which\nthree years have wrought in their appearance; for all are looking their\nbest just now.\n\nJo's angles are much softened; she has learned to carry herself with\nease, if not grace. The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,\nmore becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There is a\nfresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only\ngentle words fall from her sharp tongue to-day.\n\nBeth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever; the beautiful,\nkind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,\nalthough it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches\nthe young face with such pathetic patience; but Beth seldom complains,\nand always speaks hopefully of \"being better soon.\"\n\nAmy is with truth considered \"the flower of the family;\" for at sixteen\nshe has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman--not beautiful, but\npossessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the\nlines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her\ndress, the droop of her hair,--unconscious, yet harmonious, and as\nattractive to many as beauty itself. Amy's nose still afflicted her, for\nit never _would_ grow Grecian; so did her mouth, being too wide, and\nhaving a decided chin. These offending features gave character to her\nwhole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her\nwonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls, more golden and\nabundant than ever.\n\nAll three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the\nsummer), with blush-roses in hair and bosom; and all three looked just\nwhat they were,--fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in\ntheir busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the\nromance of womanhood.\n\nThere were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as\nnatural and homelike as possible; so when Aunt March arrived, she was\nscandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in, to\nfind the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and to\ncatch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave\ncountenance, and a wine-bottle under each arm.\n\n\"Upon my word, here's a state of things!\" cried the old lady, taking the\nseat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her lavender\n_moire_ with a great rustle. \"You oughtn't to be seen till the last\nminute, child.\"\n\n\"I'm not a show, aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to\ncriticise my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon. I'm too happy to\ncare what any one says or thinks, and I'm going to have my little\nwedding just as I like it. John, dear, here's your hammer;\" and away\nwent Meg to help \"that man\" in his highly improper employment.\n\nMr. Brooke didn't even say \"Thank you,\" but as he stooped for the\nunromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding-door,\nwith a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket-handkerchief, with\na sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.\n\nA crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous\nexclamation, \"Jupiter Ammon! Jo's upset the cake again!\" caused a\nmomentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived,\nand \"the party came in,\" as Beth used to say when a child.\n\n\"Don't let that young giant come near me; he worries me worse than\nmosquitoes,\" whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled, and\nLaurie's black head towered above the rest.\n\n\"He has promised to be very good to-day, and he _can_ be perfectly\nelegant if he likes,\" returned Amy\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
