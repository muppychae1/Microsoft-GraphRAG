Her struggles were really\npathetic; there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she took\nthe saddle to the horse. My dear creature, she actually rowed it over\nthe river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the utter\namazement of the old man!\"\n\n            [Illustration: She took the saddle to the horse]\n\n\"Did she ride the horse?\"\n\n\"Of course she did, and had a capital time. I expected to see her\nbrought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and was the\nlife of the party.\"\n\n\"Well, I call that plucky!\" and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving\nglance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the\ngirl look so red and uncomfortable.\n\nShe was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a\nsudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress. One of\nthe young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to\nthe picnic; and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it was\nbought two years ago, must needs answer, with unnecessary frankness,\n\"Oh, Amy painted it; you can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ours\nany color we like. It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister.\"\n\n\"Isn't that an original idea?\" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.\n\n\"That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There's\nnothing the child can't do. Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for\nSallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest\nshade of sky-blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,\"\nadded Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments that\nexasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her\ncard-case at her.\n\n\"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,\"\nobserved the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady,\nwho did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.\n\nAny mention of her \"works\" always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either\ngrew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a _brusque_\nremark, as now. \"Sorry you could find nothing better to read. I write\nthat rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it. Are you\ngoing to New York this winter?\"\n\nAs Miss Lamb had \"enjoyed\" the story, this speech was not exactly\ngrateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake;\nbut, fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was\nfor her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an\nabruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their\nmouths.\n\n\"Amy, we _must_ go. _Good_-by, dear; _do_ come and see us; we are\n_pining_ for a visit. I don't dare to ask _you_, Mr. Lamb; but if you\n_should_ come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away.\"\n\nJo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing style\nthat Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong\ndesire to laugh and cry at the same time.\n\n\"Didn't I do that well?\" asked Jo, with a satisfied air, as they walked\naway.\n\n\"Nothing could have been worse,\" was Amy's crushing reply. \"What\npossessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and\nboots, and all the rest of it?\"\n\n\"Why, it's funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so it's no\nuse pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season, and\nhave things as easy and fine as they do.\"\n\n\"You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our\npoverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven't a bit of proper\npride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak,\"\nsaid Amy despairingly.\n\nPoor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with the\nstiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.\n\n\"How shall I behave here?\" she asked, as they approached the third\nmansion.\n\n\"Just as you please; I wash my hands of you,\" was Amy's short answer.\n\n\"Then I'll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we'll have a\ncomfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance\nhas a bad effect upon my constitution,\" returned Jo gruffly, being\ndisturbed by her failures to suit.\n\nAn enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children\nspeedily soothed her ruffled feelings; and, leaving Amy to entertain the\nhostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted\nherself to the young folks, and found the change refreshing. She\nlistened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and\npoodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that \"Tom Brown was a brick,\"\nregardless of the improper form of praise; and when one lad proposed a\nvisit to his turtle-tank, she went with an alacrity which caused mamma\nto smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left\nin a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bear-like but affectionate, and\ndearer to her than the most faultless _coiffure_ from the hands\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VERDANTIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Verdantis is a country with a Central Institution that sets interest rates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Central Institution is responsible for setting interest rates in Verdantis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Martin Smith is the Chair of the Central Institution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET STRATEGY COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Market Strategy Committee makes decisions about interest rates in Verdantis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>Martin Smith is the Chair of the Central Institution and will answer questions at a press conference<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
