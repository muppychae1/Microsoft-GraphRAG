Morals don't sell\nnowadays;\" which was not quite a correct statement, by the way.\n\n\"You think it would do with these alterations, then?\"\n\n\"Yes; it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language good, and so\non,\" was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply.\n\n\"What do you--that is, what compensation--\" began Jo, not exactly\nknowing how to express herself.\n\n\"Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this\nsort. Pay when it comes out,\" returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point\nhad escaped him; such trifles often do escape the editorial mind, it is\nsaid.\n\n\"Very well; you can have it,\" said Jo, handing back the story, with a\nsatisfied air; for, after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five\nseemed good pay.\n\n\"Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than\nthis?\" asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and\nemboldened by her success.\n\n\"Well, we'll look at it; can't promise to take it. Tell her to make it\nshort and spicy, and never mind the moral. What name would your friend\nlike to put to it?\" in a careless tone.\n\n\"None at all, if you please; she doesn't wish her name to appear, and\nhas no _nom de plume_,\" said Jo, blushing in spite of herself.\n\n\"Just as she likes, of course. The tale will be out next week; will you\ncall for the money, or shall I send it?\" asked Mr. Dashwood, who felt a\nnatural desire to know who his new contributor might be.\n\n\"I'll call. Good morning, sir.\"\n\nAs she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful remark,\n\"Poor and proud, as usual, but she'll do.\"\n\nFollowing Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her\nmodel, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational\nliterature; but, thanks to the life-preserver thrown her by a friend,\nshe came up again, not much the worse for her ducking.\n\nLike most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and\nscenery; and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared\nupon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit\nas could be expected. Her readers were not particular about such trifles\nas grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously\npermitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it\nnecessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the\nfact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had basely\nleft him in the lurch.\n\nShe soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew\nstout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the mountains\nnext summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. One thing\ndisturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell them at\nhome. She had a feeling that father and mother would not approve, and\npreferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon afterward. It was\neasy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories; Mr.\nDashwood had, of course, found it out very soon, but promised to be\ndumb; and, for a wonder, kept his word.\n\nShe thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write\nnothing of which she should be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of\nconscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her\nearnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.\n\nBut Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales; and, as thrills could\nnot be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers, history\nand romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and lunatic\nasylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose. Jo soon found that her\ninnocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world\nwhich underlies society; so, regarding it in a business light, she set\nabout supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. Eager to\nfind material for stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if\nnot masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents,\nincidents, and crimes; she excited the suspicions of public librarians\nby asking for works on poisons; she studied faces in the street, and\ncharacters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her; she delved in the\ndust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as\ngood as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin, and misery, as well\nas her limited opportunities allowed. She thought she was prospering\nfinely; but, unconsciously, she was beginning to desecrate some of the\nwomanliest attributes of a woman's character. She was living in bad\nsociety; and, imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for\nshe was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, and\nwas fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature\nacquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to\nall of us.\n\nShe was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of\nother people's passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating\nabout her own,--a\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MR.
