Meg reasoned, pleaded, and\ncommanded: all in vain. Amy protested that she would _not_ go; and Meg\nleft her in despair, to ask Hannah what should be done. Before she came\nback, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head\nin the sofa-cushions. She told her story, expecting to be consoled; but\nLaurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,\nwhistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought. Presently he sat\ndown beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, \"Now be a\nsensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what\na jolly plan I've got. You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take\nyou out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.\nWon't that be better than moping here?\"\n\n                 [Illustration: He sat down beside her]\n\n\"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,\" began Amy, in an\ninjured voice.\n\n\"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't want to be\nsick, do you?\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure I don't; but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with\nBeth all the time.\"\n\n\"That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may\nescape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say; or, if\nit does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I advise you\nto be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke, miss.\"\n\n\"But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross,\" said Amy, looking\nrather frightened.\n\n\"It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is,\nand take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and I'll be as\nsweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us, whatever we do.\"\n\n\"Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?\"\n\n\"On my honor as a gentleman.\"\n\n\"And come every single day?\"\n\n\"See if I don't.\"\n\n\"And bring me back the minute Beth is well?\"\n\n\"The identical minute.\"\n\n\"And go to the theatre, truly?\"\n\n\"A dozen theatres, if we may.\"\n\n\"Well--I guess--I will,\" said Amy slowly.\n\n\"Good girl! Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in,\" said Laurie, with an\napproving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the \"giving in.\"\n\nMeg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been\nwrought; and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised\nto go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.\n\n\"How is the little dear?\" asked Laurie; for Beth was his especial pet,\nand he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.\n\n\"She is lying down on mother's bed, and feels better. The baby's death\ntroubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah _says_ she\nthinks so; but she _looks_ worried, and that makes me fidgety,\" answered\nMeg.\n\n\"What a trying world it is!\" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful\nsort of way. \"No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes\nanother. There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when mother's\ngone; so I'm all at sea.\"\n\n\"Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming.
