That is what troubles me--for the\nsharp words fly out before I know what I'm about; and the more I say the\nworse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's feelings, and say\ndreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.\"\n\n\"My good mother used to help me--\"\n\n\"As you do us--\" interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.\n\n\"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years\nhad to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to\nany one else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears\nover my failures; for, in spite of my efforts, I never seemed to get on.\nThen your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be\ngood. But by and by, when I had four little daughters round me, and we\nwere poor, then the old trouble began again; for I am not patient by\nnature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.\"\n\n\"Poor mother! what helped you then?\"\n\n\"Your father, Jo. He never loses patience,--never doubts or\ncomplains,--but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully, that\none is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted me,\nand showed me that I must try to practise all the virtues I would have\nmy little girls possess, for I was their example. It was easier to try\nfor your sakes than for my own; a startled or surprised look from one of\nyou, when I spoke sharply, rebuked me more than any words could have\ndone; and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the\nsweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would\nhave them copy.\"\n\n\"O mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,\" cried\nJo, much touched.\n\n\"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear; but you must keep watch\nover your 'bosom enemy,' as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not\nspoil your life. You have had a warning; remember it, and try with heart\nand soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater\nsorrow and regret than you have known to-day.\"\n\n\"I will try, mother; I truly will. But you must help me, remind me, and\nkeep me from flying out. I used to see father sometimes put his finger\non his lips, and look at you with a very kind, but sober face, and you\nalways folded your lips tight or went away: was he reminding you then?\"\nasked Jo softly.\n\n\"Yes; I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me\nfrom many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.\"\n\nJo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled, as she\nspoke; and, fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,\n\"Was it wrong to watch you, and to speak of it? I didn't mean to be\nrude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so\nsafe and happy here.\"\n\n\"My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest\nhappiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me, and know how\nmuch I love them.\"\n\n\"I thought I'd grieved you.\"\n\n\"No, dear; but speaking of father reminded me how much I miss him, how\nmuch I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his\nlittle daughters safe and good for him.\"\n\n\"Yet you told him to go, mother, and didn't cry when he went, and never\ncomplain now, or seem as if you needed any help,\" said Jo, wondering.\n\n\"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was\ngone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty and\nwill surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don't seem to need\nhelp, it is because I have a better friend, even than father, to comfort\nand sustain me. My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are\nbeginning, and may be many; but you can overcome and outlive them all if\nyou learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as\nyou do that of your earthly one. The more you love and trust Him, the\nnearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power\nand wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken\nfrom you, but may become the source of life-long peace, happiness, and\nstrength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little\ncares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUNT MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Aunt March is a character who scolds and worries Mrs. March)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character who feels close to her mother and seeks advice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
