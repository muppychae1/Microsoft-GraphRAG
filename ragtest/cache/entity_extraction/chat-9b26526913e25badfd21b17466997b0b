Meg\ngave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some\nclothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money,\nif I sold the nose off my face to get it.\"\n\n\"You needn't feel wicked, my child: you had no winter things, and got\nthe simplest with your own hard earnings,\" said Mrs. March, with a look\nthat warmed Jo's heart.\n\n\"I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went\nalong I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd like to\ndive into some of the rich stores and help myself. In a barber's window\nI saw tails of hair with the prices marked; and one black tail, not so\nthick as mine, was forty dollars. It came over me all of a sudden that I\nhad one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to think, I\nwalked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for\nmine.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you dared to do it,\" said Beth, in a tone of awe.\n\n\"Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his\nhair. He rather stared, at first, as if he wasn't used to having girls\nbounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. He said he didn't\ncare about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never paid much\nfor it in the first place; the work put into it made it dear, and so on.\nIt was getting late, and I was afraid, if it wasn't done right away,\nthat I shouldn't have it done at all, and you know when I start to do a\nthing, I hate to give it up; so I begged him to take it, and told him\nwhy I was in such a hurry. It was silly, I dare say, but it changed his\nmind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my topsy-turvy\nway, and his wife heard, and said so kindly,--\n\n\"'Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young lady; I'd do as much for our\nJimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.'\"\n\n\"Who was Jimmy?\" asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they\nwent along.\n\n\"Her son, she said, who was in the army. How friendly such things make\nstrangers feel, don't they? She talked away all the time the man\nclipped, and diverted my mind nicely.\"\n\n                    [Illustration: The man clipped]\n\n\"Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?\" asked Meg, with a\nshiver.\n\n\"I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that\nwas the end of it. I never snivel over trifles like that; I will\nconfess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on\nthe table, and felt only the short, rough ends on my head. It almost\nseemed as if I'd an arm or a leg off. The woman saw me look at it, and\npicked out a long lock for me to keep. I'll give it to you, Marmee, just\nto remember past glories by; for a crop is so comfortable I don't think\nI shall ever have a mane again.\"\n\nMrs. March folded the wavy, chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short\ngray one in her desk. She only said \"Thank you, deary,\" but something in\nher face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully as\nthey could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the prospect of a fine day\nto-morrow, and the happy times they would have when father came home to\nbe nursed.\n\nNo one wanted to go to bed, when, at ten o'clock, Mrs. March put by the\nlast finished job, and said, \"Come, girls.\" Beth went to the piano and\nplayed the father's favorite hymn; all began bravely, but broke down\none by one, till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to\nher music was always a sweet consoler.\n\n\"Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early, and shall need all\nthe sleep we can get. Good-night, my darlings,\" said Mrs. March, as the\nhymn ended, for no one cared to try another.\n\nThey kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear\ninvalid lay in the next room. Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite of\nthe great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious thoughts\nshe had ever known in her short life. Jo lay motionless, and her sister\nfancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her exclaim, as she\ntouched a wet cheek,--\n\n\"Jo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about father?\"\n\n\"No\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
