I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\ndreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\" said\nBeth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea, at the same time.\n\n\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise\nher. We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon, Meg; there is so much to\ndo about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up and down,\nwith her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.\n\n\"I don't mean to act any more after this time; I'm getting too old for\nsuch things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\n\"dressing-up\" frolics.\n\n\"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\nwith your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\nactress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\nboards,\" said Jo. \"We ought to rehearse to-night. Come here, Amy, and do\nthe fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"\n\n\"I can't help it; I never saw any one faint, and I don't choose to make\nmyself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down\neasily, I'll drop; if I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\ngraceful; I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\" returned\nAmy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she\nwas small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.\n\n          [Illustration: Do it this way, clasp your hands so]\n\n\"Do it this way; clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\ncrying frantically, 'Roderigo! save me! save me!'\" and away went Jo,\nwith a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\n\nAmy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked\nherself along as if she went by machinery; and her \"Ow!\" was more\nsuggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave\na despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread\nburn as she watched the fun, with interest.\n\n\"It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the\naudience laugh, don't blame me. Come on, Meg.\"\n\nThen things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of\ntwo pages without a single break; Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful\nincantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect;\nRoderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of\nremorse and arsenic, with a wild \"Ha! ha!\"\n\n\"It's the best we've had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and\nrubbed his elbows.\n\n\"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You're\na regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her\nsisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\n\n\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly. \"I do think 'The Witch's Curse, an\nOperatic Tragedy,' is rather a nice thing; but I'd like to try Macbeth,\nif we only had a trap-door for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing\npart. 'Is that a dagger that I see before me?'\" muttered Jo, rolling her\neyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.\n\n\"No, it's the toasting fork, with mother's shoe on it instead of the\nbread.

She was not\nelegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\ngray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\nthe world.\n\n\"Well, dearies, how have you got on to-day? There was so much to do,\ngetting the boxes ready to go to-morrow, that I didn't come home to\ndinner. Has any one called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look\ntired to death.

The girls\nflew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg\narranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,\noverturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and\nfro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave\ndirections to every one, as she sat with her hands folded.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
