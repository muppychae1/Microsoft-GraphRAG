It won't come to anything, I dare say; but I couldn't rest till I\nhad tried, and I said nothing about it, because I didn't want any one\nelse to be disappointed.\"\n\n\"It won't fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare,\ncompared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't it be\nfun to see them in print; and sha'n't we feel proud of our authoress?\"\n\nJo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in; and a\nfriend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.\n\n\"Where's _your_ secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe you\nagain,\" she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed\nup at a word of encouragement.\n\n\"I may get into a scrape for telling; but I didn't promise not to, so I\nwill, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you any plummy bit\nof news I get. I know where Meg's glove is.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and\ntwinkled, with a face full of mysterious intelligence.\n\n\"It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell you\nwhere it is.\"\n\n\"Tell, then.\"\n\nLaurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which produced a\ncomical change. She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both\nsurprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, \"How do you\nknow?\"\n\n\"Saw it.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Pocket.\"\n\n\"All this time?\"\n\n\"Yes; isn't that romantic?\"\n\n\"No, it's horrid.\"\n\n\"Don't you like it?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't. It's ridiculous; it won't be allowed. My patience!\nwhat would Meg say?\"\n\n\"You are not to tell any one; mind that.\"\n\n\"I didn't promise.\"\n\n\"That was understood, and I trusted you.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't for the present, any way; but I'm disgusted, and wish you\nhadn't told me.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd be pleased.\"\n\n\"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.\"\n\n\"You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see any one try it,\" cried Jo fiercely.\n\n\"So should I!\" and Laurie chuckled at the idea.\n\n\"I don't think secrets agree with me; I feel rumpled up in my mind since\nyou told me that,\" said Jo, rather ungratefully.\n\n\"Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,\" suggested\nLaurie.\n\nNo one was in sight; the smooth road sloped invitingly before her; and\nfinding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat\nand comb behind her, and scattering hair-pins as she ran. Laurie reached\nthe goal first, and was quite satisfied with the success of his\ntreatment; for his Atalanta came panting up, with flying hair, bright\neyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.\n\n                     [Illustration: Jo darted away]\n\n\"I wish I was a horse; then I could run for miles in this splendid air,\nand not lose my breath. It was capital; but see what a guy it's made me.\nGo, pick up my things, like a cherub as you are,\" said Jo, dropping down\nunder a maple-tree, which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.\n\nLaurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled\nup her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again. But\nsome one did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking particularly\nladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been making calls.\n\n\"What in the world are you doing here?\" she asked, regarding her\ndishevelled sister with well-bred surprise.\n\n\"Getting leaves,\" meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had\njust swept up.\n\n\"And hair-pins,\" added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's lap.\n\"They grow on this road, Meg; so do combs and brown straw hats.\"\n\n\"You have been running, Jo; how could you? When _will_ you stop such\nromping ways?\" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs, and\nsmoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.\n\n\"Never till I'm stiff and old, and have to use a crutch. Don't try to\nmake me grow up before my time, Meg: it's hard enough to have you change\nall of a sudden; let me be a little girl as long as I can.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips;\nfor lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a woman,\nand Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which must surely come\nsome time, and now seemed very near. He saw the trouble in her face, and\ndrew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, \"Where have you been\ncalling, all so fine?\"\n\n\"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle\nMoffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MISS MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Miss March is a celebrated American authoress)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character who interacts with Miss March and other characters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character who interacts with Laurie and other characters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a character who interacts with Jo and Laurie)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>MISS MARCH<|>Laurie praises Miss March's stories and encourages her to publish them<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>LAURIE<|>Jo and Laurie share a secret about Meg's glove<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>MEG<|>Jo is disheveled and collecting leaves when Meg encounters her<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>JO<|>Laurie helps Jo collect her belongings after she runs down a hill<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>JO<|>Meg reproves Jo for her romping ways and disheveled appearance<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>LAURIE<|>Meg has been making calls and discusses Belle Moffat's wedding with Laurie<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
