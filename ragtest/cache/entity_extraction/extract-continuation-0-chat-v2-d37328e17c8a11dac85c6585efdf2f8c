I'll be very good and proper now.\"\n\n\"I shall hope so,\" was all he said, but he meant more than she imagined;\nand the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words\n\"Weekly Volcano\" were printed in large type on her forehead.\n\nAs soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully\nre-read every one of her stories. Being a little short-sighted, Mr.\nBhaer sometimes used eye-glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling to\nsee how they magnified the fine print of her book; now she seemed to\nhave got on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also; for the\nfaults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully, and filled her\nwith dismay.\n\n\"They _are_ trash, and will soon be worse than trash if I go on; for\neach is more sensational than the last. I've gone blindly on, hurting\nmyself and other people, for the sake of money; I know it's so, for I\ncan't read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of\nit; and what _should_ I do if they were seen at home, or Mr. Bhaer got\nhold of them?\"\n\nJo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her\nstove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.\n\n         [Illustration: Jo stuffed the whole bundle into the stove]\n\n\"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense; I'd better\nburn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up\nwith my gunpowder,\" she thought, as she watched the \"Demon of the Jura\"\nwhisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.\n\nBut when nothing remained of all her three months' work except a heap of\nashes, and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the\nfloor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.\n\n\"I think I haven't done much harm _yet_, and may keep this to pay for my\ntime,\" she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, \"I almost\nwish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient. If I didn't care\nabout doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I\nshould get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that father and\nmother hadn't been so particular about such things.\"\n\nAh, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that \"father and mother\n_were_ particular,\" and pity from your heart those who have no such\nguardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like\nprison-walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations\nto build character upon in womanhood.\n\nJo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not\npay for her share of the sensation; but, going to the other extreme, as\nis the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs. Sherwood,\nMiss Edgeworth, and Hannah More; and then produced a tale which might\nhave been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so intensely moral\nwas it. She had her doubts about it from the beginning; for her lively\nfancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she\nwould have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the\nlast century. She sent this didactic gem to several markets, but it\nfound no purchaser; and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood,\nthat morals didn't sell.\n\nThen she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed of\nif she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it. The\nonly person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try\njuvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to\nconvert all the world to his particular belief. But much as she liked to\nwrite for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys\nas being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls, because they did not go\nto a particular Sabbath-school, nor all the good infants, who did go, as\nrewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to escorts of\nangels, when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their\nlisping tongues. So nothing came of these trials; and Jo corked up her\ninkstand, and said, in a fit of very wholesome humility,--\n\n\"I don't know anything; I'll wait till I do before I try again, and,\nmeantime, 'sweep mud in the street,' if I can't do better; that's\nhonest, at least;\" which decision proved that her second tumble down the\nbean-stalk had done her some good.\n\nWhile these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had\nbeen as busy and uneventful as usual; and if she sometimes looked\nserious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer. He did\nit so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would\naccept and profit by his reproof; but\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR<|>PERSON<|>The Professor is a mentor to Jo and provides guidance and feedback on her writing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a writer who struggles with the moral implications of her work)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEEKLY VOLCANO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A publication that Jo is concerned will judge her work harshly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
