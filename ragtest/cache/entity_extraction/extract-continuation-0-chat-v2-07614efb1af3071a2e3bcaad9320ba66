to-night.\n\n        We all are here in perfect health,\n          None gone from our small band;\n        Again we see each well-known face,\n          And press each friendly hand.\n\n        Our Pickwick, always at his post,\n          With reverence we greet,\n        As, spectacles on nose, he reads\n          Our well-filled weekly sheet.\n\n        Although he suffers from a cold,\n          We joy to hear him speak,\n        For words of wisdom from him fall,\n          In spite of croak or squeak.\n\n        Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,\n          With elephantine grace,\n        And beams upon the company,\n          With brown and jovial face.\n\n        Poetic fire lights up his eye,\n          He struggles 'gainst his lot.\n        Behold ambition on his brow,\n          And on his nose a blot!\n\n        Next our peaceful Tupman comes,\n          So rosy, plump, and sweet.\n        Who chokes with laughter at the puns,\n          And tumbles off his seat.\n\n        Prim little Winkle too is here,\n          With every hair in place,\n        A model of propriety,\n          Though he hates to wash his face.\n\n        The year is gone, we still unite\n          To joke and laugh and read,\n        And tread the path of literature\n          That doth to glory lead.\n\n        Long may our paper prosper well,\n          Our club unbroken be,\n        And coming years their blessings pour\n          On the useful, gay \"P.

SNODGRASS.\n\n\n                          THE MASKED MARRIAGE.\n\n                           A TALE OF VENICE.\n\n    Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its\n    lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the\n    stately halls of Count de Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and\n    pages, monks and flower-girls, all mingled gayly in the dance.\n    Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air; and so with mirth\n    and music the masquerade went on.\n\n    \"Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola to-night?\" asked a\n    gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall\n    upon his arm.\n\n    \"Yes; is she not lovely, though so sad! Her dress is well\n    chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she\n    passionately hates.\"\n\n    \"By my faith, I envy him. Yonder he comes, arrayed like a\n    bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see\n    how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though\n    her stern father bestows her hand,\" returned the troubadour.\n\n    \"'Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist who\n    haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old count,\" said the\n    lady, as they joined the dance.\n\n    The revel was at its height when a priest appeared, and,\n    withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet,\n    he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell upon the gay\n    throng; and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle\n    of orange-groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush, as\n    Count de Adelon spoke thus:--\n\n    \"My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered\n    you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait\n    your services.\"\n\n    All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a low murmur of\n    amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom\n    removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts,\n    but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over.\n    Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding an\n    explanation.\n\n    \"Gladly would I give it if I could; but I only know that it was\n    the whim of my timid Viola, and I yielded to it. Now, my\n    children, let the play end. Unmask, and receive my blessing.\"\n\n    But neither bent the knee; for the young bridegroom replied, in\n    a tone that startled all listeners, as the mask fell, disclosing\n    the noble face of Ferdinand Devereux, the artist lover; and,\n    leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an English\n    earl, was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.\n\n    \"My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when I\n    could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the Count\n    Antonio. I can do more; for even your ambitious soul cannot\n    refuse the Earl of Devereux and De Vere, when he gives his\n    ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand\n    of this fair lady, now my wife.\"\n\n    The count stood like one changed to stone; and, turning to the\n    bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph,\n    \"To you, my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing\n    may prosper as mine has done; and that you may all win as fair a\n    bride as I have, by this masked marriage.\"\n\n                                                        S.
