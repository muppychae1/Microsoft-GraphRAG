Laurie comes\nnaturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare\nsay his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician; at any\nrate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he\n'glowered,' as Jo said.\"\n\n\"Dear me, how romantic!\" exclaimed Meg.\n\n\"How silly!\" said Jo. \"Let him be a musician, if he wants to, and not\nplague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\"\n\n\"That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I\nsuppose. Italians are always nice,\" said Meg, who was a little\nsentimental.\n\n\"What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never spoke to\nhim, hardly,\" cried Jo, who was _not_ sentimental.\n\n\"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to\nbehave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent\nhim.\"\n\n\"He meant the blanc-mange, I suppose.\"\n\n\"How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course.\"\n\n\"Did he?\" and Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her\nbefore.\n\n\"I never saw such a girl! You don't know a compliment when you get it,\"\nsaid Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.\n\n\"I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be silly,\nand spoil my fun. Laurie's a nice boy, and I like him, and I won't have\nany sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. We'll all be\ngood to him, because he hasn't got any mother, and he _may_ come over\nand see us, mayn't he, Marmee?\"\n\n\"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will\nremember that children should be children as long as they can.\"\n\n\"I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet,\" observed\nAmy. \"What do you say, Beth?\"\n\n\"I was thinking about our 'Pilgrim's Progress,'\" answered Beth, who had\nnot heard a word. \"How we got out of the Slough and through the Wicket\nGate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying; and that\nmaybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going to be our\nPalace Beautiful.\"\n\n\"We have got to get by the lions, first,\" said Jo, as if she rather\nliked the prospect.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                                  VI.\n\n                    BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL.\n\n\nThe big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for\nall to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr.\nLaurence was the biggest one; but after he had called, said something\nfunny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with\ntheir mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The\nother lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich; for this\nmade them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But,\nafter a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and\ncould not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's\nmotherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in\nthat humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride, and\ninterchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.\n\nAll sorts of pleasant things happened about that time; for the new\nfriendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and\nhe privately informed his tutor that \"the Marches were regularly\nsplendid girls.\" With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the\nsolitary boy into their midst, and made much of him, and he found\nsomething very charming in the innocent companionship of these\nsimple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick\nto feel the influences they brought about him; and their busy, lively\nways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of\nbooks, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged\nto make very unsatisfactory reports; for Laurie was always playing\ntruant, and running over to the Marches.\n\n\"Never mind; let him take a holiday, and make it up afterwards,\" said\nthe old gentleman. \"The good lady next door says he is studying too\nhard, and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is\nright, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his\ngrandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can't\nget into mischief in that little nunnery over there; and Mrs. March is\ndoing more for him than we can.\"\n\nWhat good times they had, to be sure! Such plays and tableaux, such\nsleigh-rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old\nparlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg\ncould walk in the conservatory whenever she liked, and revel in\nbouquets; Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the\nold gentleman with her criticisms; Amy copied pictures, and enjoyed\nbeauty to her heart's content; and Laurie played \"lord of the manor\" in\nthe most delightful style.\n\nBut\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
