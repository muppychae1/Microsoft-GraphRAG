I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to make nice\n    button-holes, when the parlor-door opened and shut, and some one\n    began to hum,--\n\n                         'Kennst du das land,'\n\n    like a big bumble-bee. It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I\n    couldn't resist the temptation; and lifting one end of the\n    curtain before the glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer was\n    there; and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at\n    him. A regular German,--rather stout, with brown hair tumbled\n    all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I\n    ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good,\n    after our sharp or slipshod American gabble. His clothes were\n    rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome\n    feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth; yet I liked\n    him, for he had a fine head; his linen was very nice, and he\n    looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat,\n    and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite of\n    his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth\n    bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like\n    an old friend. Then he smiled; and when a tap came at the door,\n    called out in a loud, brisk tone,--\n\n    \"'Herein!'\n\n    \"I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a\n    child carrying a big book, and stopped to see what was going on.\n\n    \"'Me wants my Bhaer,' said the mite, slamming down her book, and\n    running to meet him.\n\n    \"'Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer; come, then, and take a goot hug from\n    him, my Tina,' said the Professor, catching her up, with a\n    laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she had to\n    stoop her little face to kiss him.\n\n                [Illustration: Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer]\n\n    \"'Now me mus tuddy my lessin,' went on the funny little thing;\n    so he put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she\n    had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled\n    away, turning a leaf now and then, and passing her little fat\n    finger down the page, as if finding a word, so soberly that I\n    nearly betrayed myself by a laugh, while Mr. Bhaer stood\n    stroking her pretty hair, with a fatherly look, that made me\n    think she must be his own, though she looked more French than\n    German.\n\n    \"Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me\n    back to my work, and there I virtuously remained through all the\n    noise and gabbling that went on next door. One of the girls kept\n    laughing affectedly, and saying 'Now Professor,' in a\n    coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an\n    accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.\n\n    \"Both seemed to try his patience sorely; for more than once I\n    heard him say emphatically, 'No, no, it is _not_ so; you haf not\n    attend to what I say;' and once there was a loud rap, as if he\n    struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing\n    exclamation, 'Prut! it all goes bad this day.'\n\n    \"Poor man, I pitied him; and when the girls were gone, took just\n    one more peep, to see if he survived it. He seemed to have\n    thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with\n    his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put\n    his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and,\n    taking little Tina, who had fallen asleep on the sofa, in his\n    arms, he carried her quietly away. I fancy he has a hard life of\n    it.\n\n    \"Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five o'clock\n    dinner; and, feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would,\n    just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me.\n    So I made myself respectable, and tried to slip in behind Mrs.\n    Kirke; but as she is short, and I'm tall, my efforts at\n    concealment were rather a failure. She gave me a seat by her,\n    and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage, and looked\n    about me. The long table was full, and every one intent on\n    getting their dinner,--the gentlemen especially, who seemed to\n    be eating on time, for they _bolted_ in every sense of the word,\n    vanishing as soon as they were done. There was the usual\n    assortment of young men absorbed in themselves; young couples\n    absorbed in each other; married ladies in their babies, and old\n    gentlemen in politics. I don't think I shall care to have much\n    to do with any of them, except one sweet-faced maiden lady, who\n    looks as if she had\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR BHAER<|>PERSON<|>Professor Bhaer is a German man with a kind demeanor, messy appearance, and a love for teaching and children)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TINA<|>PERSON<|>Tina is a young child who is affectionate towards Professor Bhaer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
