No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too\ngradually to startle those who saw her daily; but to eyes sharpened by\nabsence, it was very plain; and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she\nsaw her sister's face. It was no paler and but little thinner than in\nthe autumn; yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if\nthe mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining\nthrough the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw\nand felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression\nlost much of its power; for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt\nthat she was better; and, presently, in other cares, Jo for a time\nforgot her fear.\n\nBut when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety\nreturned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and been forgiven;\nbut when she showed her savings and proposed the mountain trip, Beth had\nthanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from home.\nAnother little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and, as\ngrandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth\ndown to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open air, and\nlet the fresh sea-breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks.\n\nIt was not a fashionable place, but, even among the pleasant people\nthere, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.\nBeth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care\nfor any one else; so they were all in all to each other, and came and\nwent, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about\nthem, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble\none, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long\nseparation was not far away.\n\nThey did feel it, yet neither spoke of it; for often between ourselves\nand those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is\nvery hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart\nand Beth's; but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there seemed\nsomething sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to speak. She\nwondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see\nwhat she saw; and, during the quiet weeks, when the shadow grew so plain\nto her, she said nothing of it to those at home, believing that it would\ntell itself when Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if\nher sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing\nthrough her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks,\nwith her head in Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her,\nand the sea made music at her feet.\n\n     [Illustration: With her head in Jo's lap, while the wind blew\n                        healthfully over her]\n\nOne day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still; and,\nputting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying to\nsee signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks. But she could not\nfind enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands\nseemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been\ngathering. It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was\nslowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively tightened\ntheir hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a minute her\neyes were too dim for seeing, and, when they cleared, Beth was looking\nup at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say,--\n\n\"Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it. I've tried to tell you, but I\ncouldn't.\"\n\nThere was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own, not even\ntears; for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry. She was the weaker,\nthen, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about\nher, and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.\n\n\"I've known it for a good while, dear, and, now I'm used to it, it isn't\nhard to think of or to bear. Try to see it so, and don't be troubled\nabout me, because it's best; indeed it is.\"\n\n\"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel\nit then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?\" asked Jo, refusing\nto see or say that it _was_ best, but glad to know that Laurie had no\npart in Beth's trouble.\n\n\"Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I tried to\nthink it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble any one. But\nwhen I saw you all so well and strong, and full of happy plans, it was\nhard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,\nJo.\"\n\n\"O Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and help you! How\ncould you shut me out, and bear it all alone?\"\n\nJo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of\nthe solitary struggle\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a caring sister who is concerned about her sister Beth's well-being)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is Jo's sister who is slowly drifting away due to an illness)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>BETH<|>Jo is deeply concerned about Beth's health and tries to comfort her<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>BETH<|>Beth is slowly drifting away due to an illness, causing Jo great distress<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
