It was gone directly, however, for Laurie\nsaid, with a vain attempt at dignity,--\n\n\"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?\"\n\n\"Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier, but you\nare the same scapegrace as ever.\"\n\n\"Now, really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,\" began\nLaurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.\n\n\"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so\nirresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!\" answered Jo, smiling all\nover her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then\nsettled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.\n\n\"It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all\ncoming up presently. I couldn't wait; I wanted to be the one to tell you\nthe grand surprise, and have 'first skim,' as we used to say when we\nsquabbled about the cream.\"\n\n\"Of course you did, and spoilt your story by beginning at the wrong end.\nNow, start right, and tell me how it all happened; I'm pining to know.\"\n\n\"Well, I did it to please Amy,\" began Laurie, with a twinkle that made\nJo exclaim,--\n\n\"Fib number one; Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell the truth, if\nyou can, sir.\"\n\n\"Now she's beginning to marm it; isn't it jolly to hear her?\" said\nLaurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite\nagreed. \"It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned to\ncome home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly\nchanged their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But\ngrandpa wanted to come home; he went to please me, and I couldn't let\nhim go alone, neither could I leave Amy; and Mrs. Carrol had got English\nnotions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy come\nwith us. So I just settled the difficulty by saying, 'Let's be married,\nand then we can do as we like.'\"\n\n\"Of course you did; you always have things to suit you.\"\n\n\"Not always;\" and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily,--\n\n\"How did you ever get aunt to agree?\"\n\n\"It was hard work; but, between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps\nof good reasons on our side. There wasn't time to write and ask leave,\nbut you all liked it, had consented to it by and by, and it was only\n'taking Time by the fetlock,' as my wife says.\"\n\n\"Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?\"\ninterrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with\ndelight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so\ntragically gloomy when she saw them last.\n\n\"A trifle, perhaps; she's such a captivating little woman I can't help\nbeing proud of her. Well, then, uncle and aunt were there to play\npropriety; we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use\napart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all\nround; so we did it.\"\n\n\"When, where, how?\" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and\ncuriosity, for she could not realize it a particle.\n\n\"Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris; a very quiet\nwedding, of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear\nlittle Beth.\"\n\nJo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the\nlittle red pillow, which he remembered well.\n\n\"Why didn't you let us know afterward?\" asked Jo, in a quieter tone,\nwhen they had sat quite still a minute.\n\n\"We wanted to surprise you; we thought we were coming directly home, at\nfirst; but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found he\ncouldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend our\nhoneymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular\nhoneymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but\nonce in their lives. My faith! wasn't it love among the roses!\"\n\nLaurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it; for the\nfact that he told her these things so freely and naturally assured her\nthat he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away her\nhand; but, as if he guessed the thought that prompted the\nhalf-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly\ngravity she had never seen in him before,--\n\n\"Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by forever. As\nI told you in my letter, when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me, I\nnever shall stop loving you; but the love is altered, and I have learned\nto see that it is better as it is. Amy and you change places in my\nheart, that's all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have come\nabout naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me; but I never\ncould be patient, and so I got a heartache.
