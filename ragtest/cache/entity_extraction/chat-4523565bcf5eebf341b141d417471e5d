The fact that a\nsomewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected\nbonnet, attracted her attention; and, looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer\nlooking down.\n\n              [Illustration: Looking up she saw Mr. Bhaer]\n\n\"I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many\nhorse-noses, and so fast through much mud. What do you down here, my\nfriend?\"\n\n\"I'm shopping.\"\n\nMr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle-factory on one side, to\nthe wholesale hide and leather concern on the other; but he only said\npolitely,--\n\n\"You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take for you the bundles?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you.\"\n\nJo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought\nof her; but she didn't care, for in a minute she found herself walking\naway arm-in-arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly\nburst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,\nand that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that\nday.\n\n\"We thought you had gone,\" said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking\nat her. Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face, and she feared he\nmight think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.\n\n\"Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been\nso heavenly kind to me?\" he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if\nshe had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered heartily,--\n\n\"No, _I_ didn't; I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we\nrather missed you,--father and mother especially.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I'm always glad to see you, sir.\"\n\nIn her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool, and\nthe frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the Professor,\nfor his smile vanished, as he said gravely,--\n\n\"I thank you, and come one time more before I go.\"\n\n\"You _are_ going, then?\"\n\n\"I haf no longer any business here; it is done.\"\n\n\"Successfully, I hope?\" said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment\nwas in that short reply of his.\n\n\"I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make\nmy bread and gif my JÃ¼nglings much help.\"\n\n\"Tell me, please! I like to know all about the--the boys,\" said Jo\neagerly.\n\n\"That is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for me a place in\na college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way\nsmooth for Franz and Emil. For this I should be grateful, should I not?\"\n\n\"Indeed you should. How splendid it will be to have you doing what you\nlike, and be able to see you often, and the boys!\" cried Jo, clinging to\nthe lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying.\n\n\"Ah! but we shall not meet often, I fear; this place is at the West.\"\n\n\"So far away!\" and Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn't\nmatter now what became of her clothes or herself.\n\nMr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read\nwomen yet. He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, and was,\ntherefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and manner,\nwhich she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was in half a\ndozen different moods in the course of half an hour. When she met him\nshe looked surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that\nshe had come for that express purpose. When he offered her his arm, she\ntook it with a look that filled him with delight; but when he asked if\nshe missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply that despair fell\nupon him. On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands: was\nthe joy all for the boys? Then, on hearing his destination, she said,\n\"So far away!\" in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of\nhope; but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, like\none entirely absorbed in the matter,--\n\n\"Here's the place for my errands; will you come in? It won't take long.\"\n\nJo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and\nparticularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and despatch\nwith which she would accomplish the business. But, owing to the flutter\nshe was in, everything went amiss; she upset the tray of needles, forgot\nthe silesia was to be \"twilled\" till it was cut off, gave the wrong\nchange, and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon\nat the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching her blush and\nblunder; and, as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed to subside,\nfor he was beginning to see that on some occasions women, like dreams,\ngo by contraries.\n\nWhen they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful\naspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it, on\nthe whole.\n\n\"Should we not do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and\nhaf a farewell feast to-night if I go for my last call at your so\npleasant home?\" he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and\nflowers.\n\n\"What\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
