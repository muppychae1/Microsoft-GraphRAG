He rather missed the \"petting\" he used to receive, and enjoyed a\ntaste of it again; for no attentions, however flattering, from\nstrangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls\nat home. Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very glad\nto see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the\nrepresentative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she\nwould confess. They naturally took comfort in each other's society, and\nwere much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for, at Nice,\nno one can be very industrious during the gay season. But, while\napparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were\nhalf-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each\nother. Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sunk in\nhers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. Amy tried to\nplease, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he\ngave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women\nknow how to lend an indescribable charm. Laurie made no effort of any\nkind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible,\ntrying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind word\nbecause one had been cold to him. It cost him no effort to be generous,\nand he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she would have\ntaken them; but, at the same time, he felt that he could not change the\nopinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes\nthat seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful\nsurprise.\n\n\"All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day; I preferred to stay at\nhome and write letters. They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa to\nsketch; will you come?\" said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely day\nwhen he lounged in as usual, about noon.\n\n\"Well, yes; but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?\" he answered\nslowly, for the shaded _salon_ looked inviting, after the glare without.\n\n\"I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so\nyou'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves\nnice,\" returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids,\nwhich were a weak point with Laurie.\n\n\"Then I'll go with pleasure;\" and he put out his hand for her\nsketch-book. But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp--\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself; it's no exertion to me, but _you_ don't look\nequal to it.\"\n\nLaurie lifted his eyebrows, and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran\ndownstairs; but when they got into the carriage he took the reins\nhimself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and\nfall asleep on his perch.\n\nThe two never quarrelled,--Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie\nwas too lazy; so, in a minute he peeped under her hat-brim with an\ninquiring air; she answered with a smile, and they went on together in\nthe most amicable manner.\n\nIt was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque\nscenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient monastery,\nwhence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There a\nbare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket\nover one shoulder, sat piping on a stone, while his goats skipped among\nthe rocks or lay at his feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with\npanniers of freshly-cut grass, passed by, with a pretty girl in a\n_capaline_ sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning\nwith a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the\nquaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on\nthe bough. Gnarled olive-trees covered the hills with their dusky\nfoliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones\nfringed the roadside; while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the\nMaritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.\n\nValrosa well deserved its name, for, in that climate of perpetual\nsummer, roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust\nthemselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to\npassers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon-trees and\nfeathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where\nseats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom; every cool\ngrotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers, and every\nfountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to\nsmile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped\nthe cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of\nthe wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and\nthe white-walled city on its shore.\n\n\"This is a regular honeymoon Paradise, isn't it? Did you ever see such\nroses?\" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a\nluxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.\n\n\"No,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
