For a small thing it was a great success; and Jo was more\nastonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once.\n\n\"I don't understand it. What _can_ there be in a simple little story\nlike that, to make people praise it so?\" she said, quite bewildered.\n\n\"There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret; humor and pathos make it\nalive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote with no thought\nof fame or money, and put your heart into it, my daughter; you have had\nthe bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your best, and grow as happy as we\nare in your success.\"\n\n\"If there _is_ anything good or true in what I write, it isn't mine; I\nowe it all to you and mother and to Beth,\" said Jo, more touched by her\nfather's words than by any amount of praise from the world.\n\nSo, taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent\nthem away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very\ncharitable world to such humble wanderers; for they were kindly\nwelcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like dutiful\nchildren whom good fortune overtakes.\n\nWhen Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that Jo\nwould find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon set\nat rest; for, though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very quietly,\nand was full of hopes and plans for \"the children\" before she read the\nletter twice. It was a sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the\nother in lover-like fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to\nthink of, for no one had any objection to make.\n\n\"You like it, mother?\" said Jo, as they laid down the closely written\nsheets, and looked at one another.\n\n\"Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused\nFred. I felt sure then that something better than what you call the\n'mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a hint here and there in her\nletters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day.\"\n\n\"How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a word to\nme.\"\n\n\"Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have\ngirls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your head, lest\nyou should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled.\"\n\n\"I'm not the scatter-brain I was; you may trust me, I'm sober and\nsensible enough for any one's _confidante_ now.\"\n\n\"So you are, dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied it\nmight pain you to learn that your Teddy loved any one else.\"\n\n\"Now, mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish,\nafter I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?\"\n\n\"I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he\ncame back, and asked again, you might, perhaps, feel like giving another\nanswer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that you are very lonely,\nand sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart;\nso I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now.\"\n\n\"No, mother, it is better as it is, and I'm glad Amy has learned to love\nhim. But you are right in one thing: I _am_ lonely, and perhaps if Teddy\nhad tried again, I might have said 'Yes,' not because I love him any\nmore, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are\nplenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with father and mother,\nsisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all\ncomes to give you your reward.\"\n\n\"Mothers are the _best_ lovers in the world; but I don't mind whispering\nto Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very curious, but the\nmore I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the\nmore I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts could take in so many; mine is\nso elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite contented\nwith my family. I don't understand it.\"\n\n\"I do;\" and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the\nleaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.\n\n\"It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me; he isn't\nsentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he\nsays and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don't seem\nto be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and generous and tender\nhe was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it full of\nnoble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know it's\nmine. He says he feels as if he 'could make a prosperous voyage now\nwith me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast.' I pray he may,\nand try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain with all\nmy heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while God lets\nus\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
