He did\nit so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would\naccept and profit by his reproof; but she stood the test, and he was\nsatisfied; for, though no words passed between them, he knew that she\nhad given up writing. Not only did he guess it by the fact that the\nsecond finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her\nevenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and\nstudied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on\noccupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.\n\nHe helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was\nhappy; for, while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons\nbeside German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her\nown life.\n\nIt was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs.\nKirke till June. Every one seemed sorry when the time came; the children\nwere inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up all over his\nhead, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.\n\n\"Going home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,\" he said,\nwhen she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard, in the corner,\nwhile she held a little levee on that last evening.\n\nShe was going early, so she bade them all good-by over night; and when\nhis turn came, she said warmly,--\n\n\"Now, sir, you won't forget to come and see us, if you ever travel our\nway, will you? I'll never forgive you if you do, for I want them all to\nknow my friend.\"\n\n\"Do you? Shall I come?\" he asked, looking down at her with an eager\nexpression which she did not see.\n\n\"Yes, come next month; Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy\nCommencement as something new.\"\n\n\"That is your best friend, of whom you speak?\" he said, in an altered\ntone.\n\n\"Yes, my boy Teddy; I'm very proud of him, and should like you to see\nhim.\"\n\nJo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in\nthe prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr. Bhaer's\nface suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a\n\"best friend,\" and, simply because she particularly wished not to look\nas if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush; and the\nmore she tried not to, the redder she grew. If it had not been for Tina\non her knee, she didn't know what would have become of her. Fortunately,\nthe child was moved to hug her; so she managed to hide her face an\ninstant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and his own\nchanged again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression, as he\nsaid cordially,--\n\n\"I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much\nsuccess, and you all happiness. Gott bless you!\" and with that, he shook\nhands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.\n\nBut after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire, with the\ntired look on his face, and the \"_heimweh_,\" or homesickness, lying\nheavy at his heart. Once, when he remembered Jo, as she sat with the\nlittle child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his\nhead on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in\nsearch of something that he could not find.\n\n\"It is not for me; I must not hope it now,\" he said to himself, with a\nsigh that was almost a groan; then, as if reproaching himself for the\nlonging that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two towzled\nheads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened\nhis Plato.\n\nHe did his best, and did it manfully; but I don't think he found that a\npair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very\nsatisfactory substitutes for wife and child and home.\n\nEarly as it was, he was at the station, next morning, to see Jo off;\nand, thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant\nmemory of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to\nkeep her company, and, best of all, the happy thought,--\n\n\"Well, the winter's gone, and I've written no books, earned no fortune;\nbut I've made a friend worth having, and I'll try to keep him all my\nlife.\"\n\n\n\n\n          [Illustration: He put the sisters into the carriage]\n\n                                 XXXV.\n\n                               HEARTACHE.\n\n\nWhatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose that\nyear, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with the\ngrace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his friends\nsaid.
