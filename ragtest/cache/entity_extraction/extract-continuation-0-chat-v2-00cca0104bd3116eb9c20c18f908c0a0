Jo! where are you?\" cried Meg, at the foot of the garret stairs.\n\n\"Here!\" answered a husky voice from above; and, running up, Meg found\nher sister eating apples and crying over the \"Heir of Redclyffe,\"\nwrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny\nwindow. This was Jo's favorite refuge; and here she loved to retire with\nhalf a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society\nof a pet rat who lived near by, and didn't mind her a particle. As Meg\nappeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her\ncheeks, and waited to hear the news.\n\n\"Such fun! only see! a regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for\nto-morrow night!\" cried Meg, waving the precious paper, and then\nproceeding to read it, with girlish delight.\n\n\"'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a\nlittle dance on New-Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go; now\nwhat _shall_ we wear?\"\n\n\"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins,\nbecause we haven't got anything else?\" answered Jo, with her mouth full.\n\n\"If I only had a silk!\" sighed Meg. \"Mother says I may when I'm\neighteen, perhaps; but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\"\n\n\"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.\nYours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.\nWhatever shall I do? the burn shows badly, and I can't take any out.\"\n\n\"You must sit still all you can, and keep your back out of sight; the\nfront is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee\nwill lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and\nmy gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like.\"\n\n\"Mine are spoilt with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I shall\nhave to go without,\" said Jo, who never troubled herself much about\ndress.\n\n\"You _must_ have gloves, or I won't go,\" cried Meg decidedly. \"Gloves\nare more important than anything else; you can't dance without them, and\nif you don't I should be _so_ mortified.\"\n\n\"Then I'll stay still. I don't care much for company dancing; it's no\nfun to go sailing round; I like to fly about and cut capers.\"\n\n\"You can't ask mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are\nso careless. She said, when you spoilt the others, that she shouldn't\nget you any more this winter. Can't you make them do?\" asked Meg\nanxiously.\n\n\"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained\nthey are; that's all I can do. No! I'll tell you how we can manage--each\nwear one good one and carry a bad one; don't you see?\"\n\n\"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove\ndreadfully,\" began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.\n\n\"Then I'll go without.
