We had a flurry getting\nthe old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to me, for I\nwas in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and\nsweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me. I quaked\ntill she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright, for, as it\ndrove off, she popped out her head, saying, 'Josy-phine, won't you--?'\nI didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled; I did actually\nrun, and whisked round the corner, where I felt safe.\"\n\n\"Poor old Jo! she came in looking as if bears were after her,\" said\nBeth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.\n\n\"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?\" observed Amy, tasting\nher mixture critically.\n\n\"She means _vampire_, not sea-weed; but it doesn't matter; it's too warm\nto be particular about one's parts of speech,\" murmured Jo.\n\n\"What shall you do all your vacation?\" asked Amy, changing the subject,\nwith tact.\n\n\"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,\" replied Meg, from the depths of\nthe rocking-chair. \"I've been routed up early all winter, and had to\nspend my days working for other people; so now I'm going to rest and\nrevel to my heart's content.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jo; \"that dozy way wouldn't suit me. I've laid in a heap of\nbooks, and I'm going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in\nthe old apple-tree, when I'm not having l------\"\n\n\"Don't say 'larks!'\" implored Amy, as a return snub for the \"samphire\"\ncorrection.\n\n\"I'll say 'nightingales,' then, with Laurie; that's proper and\nappropriate, since he's a warbler.\"\n\n\"Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time,\nand rest, as the girls mean to,\" proposed Amy.\n\n\"Well, I will, if mother doesn't mind. I want to learn some new songs,\nand my children need fitting up for the summer; they are dreadfully out\nof order, and really suffering for clothes.\"\n\n\"May we, mother?\" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing, in\nwhat they called \"Marmee's corner.\"\n\n\"You may try your experiment for a week, and see how you like it.

Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock; her\nsolitary breakfast did not taste nice, and the room seemed lonely and\nuntidy; for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy's\nbooks lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but \"Marmee's\ncorner,\" which looked as usual; and there Meg sat, to \"rest and read,\"\nwhich meant yawn, and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get\nwith her salary. Jo spent the morning on the river, with Laurie, and the\nafternoon reading and crying over \"The Wide, Wide World,\" up in the\napple-tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet,\nwhere her family resided; but, getting tired before half done, she left\nher establishment topsy-turvy, and went to her music, rejoicing that she\nhad no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white\nfrock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw, under the honeysuckles,\nhoping some one would see and inquire who the young artist was. As no\none appeared but an inquisitive daddy-long-legs, who examined her work\nwith interest, she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home\ndripping.\n\n                  [Illustration: Amy sat down to draw]\n\nAt tea-time they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a\ndelightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping in the\nafternoon, and got a \"sweet blue muslin,\" had discovered, after she had\ncut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her\nslightly cross. Jo had burnt the skin off her nose boating, and got a\nraging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion\nof her closet, and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at\nonce; and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy\nBrown's party was to be the next day; and now, like Flora McFlimsey, she\nhad \"nothing to wear.\" But these were mere trifles; and they assured\ntheir mother that the experiment was working finely.
