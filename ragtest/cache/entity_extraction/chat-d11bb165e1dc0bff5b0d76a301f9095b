So did every one else, even\n\"Croaker,\" as the girls called the old lady; and the unfortunate dinner\nended gayly, with bread and butter, olives and fun.\n\n\"I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober\nourselves with a funeral,\" said Jo, as they rose; and Miss Crocker made\nready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's\ndinner-table.\n\nThey did sober themselves, for Beth's sake; Laurie dug a grave under the\nferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears, by his\ntender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of\nviolets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,\ncomposed by Jo, while she struggled with the dinner:--\n\n        \"Here lies Pip March,\n           Who died the 7th of June;\n         Loved and lamented sore,\n           And not forgotten soon.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome\nwith emotion and lobster; but there was no place of repose, for the beds\nwere not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up\npillows and putting things in order. Meg helped Jo clear away the\nremains of the feast, which took half the afternoon, and left them so\ntired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.\nLaurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour\ncream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs. March came\nhome to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the\nafternoon; and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of\none part of the experiment.\n\nBefore the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was a\nscramble to get ready to see them; then tea must be got, errands done;\nand one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected till the last minute.\nAs twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered in the porch\nwhere the June roses were budding beautifully, and each groaned or\nsighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.\n\n\"What a dreadful day this has been!\" begun Jo, usually the first to\nspeak.\n\n\"It has seemed shorter than usual, but _so_ uncomfortable,\" said Meg.\n\n\"Not a bit like home,\" added Amy.\n\n\"It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip,\" sighed Beth, glancing,\nwith full eyes, at the empty cage above her head.\n\n\"Here's mother, dear, and you shall have another bird to-morrow, if you\nwant it.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as\nif her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.\n\n\"Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another\nweek of it?\" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her, and the rest turned\ntoward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.\n\n\"I don't!\" cried Jo decidedly.\n\n\"Nor I,\" echoed the others.\n\n\"You think, then, that it is better to have a few duties, and live a\nlittle for others, do you?\"\n\n\"Lounging and larking doesn't pay,\" observed Jo, shaking her head. \"I'm\ntired of it, and mean to go to work at something right off.\"\n\n\"Suppose you learn plain cooking; that's a useful accomplishment, which\nno woman should be without,\" said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly at the\nrecollection of Jo's dinner-party; for she had met Miss Crocker, and\nheard her account of it.\n\n\"Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we'd get\non?\" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.\n\n\"Yes; I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing\nher share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, you got on\npretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable; so I\nthought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when every\none thinks only of herself. Don't you feel that it is pleasanter to help\none another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it\ncomes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and lovely\nto us all?\"\n\n\"We do, mother, we do!\" cried the girls.\n\n\"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again; for though\nthey seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as we learn\nto carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for every one; it\nkeeps us from _ennui_ and mischief, is good for health and spirits, and\ngives us a sense of power and independence better than money or\nfashion.\"\n\n\"We'll work like bees, and love it too; see if we don't!\" said Jo. \"I'll\nlearn plain cooking for my holiday task; and the next dinner-party I\nhave shall be a success.\"\n\n\"I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it,\nMarmee. I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing; that will be\nbetter than fussing over my own things\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
