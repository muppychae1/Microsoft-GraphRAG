He needs some one to\n    look after him when Frank is not with him. Kate said once she\n    hoped he'd marry soon, and I quite agree with her that it would\n    be well for him. Frankfort was delightful; I saw Goethe's house,\n    Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous 'Ariadne.' It was very\n    lovely, but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the\n    story better. I didn't like to ask, as every one knew it, or\n    pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all about it; I\n    ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything, and\n    it mortifies me.\n\n    \"Now comes the serious part,--for it happened here, and Fred is\n    just gone. He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite\n    fond of him; I never thought of anything but a travelling\n    friendship, till the serenade night. Since then I've begun to\n    feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily\n    adventures were something more to him than fun. I haven't\n    flirted, mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and\n    have done my very best. I can't help it if people like me; I\n    don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for\n    them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know mother\n    will shake her head, and the girls say, 'Oh, the mercenary\n    little wretch!' but I've made up my mind, and, if Fred asks me,\n    I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in love. I like him,\n    and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young,\n    clever enough, and very rich,--ever so much richer than the\n    Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I should\n    be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous\n    people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have\n    the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one as it is! A city\n    house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses,\n    but twice as comfortable, and full of solid luxury, such as\n    English people believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've\n    seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and\n    pictures of the country place, with its park, great house,\n    lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should\n    ask! and I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap up\n    so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I\n    hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I\n    can help. One of us _must_ marry well; Meg didn't, Jo won't,\n    Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make everything cosey all round.\n    I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of\n    that; and, though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well,\n    and, in time, I should get fond enough of him if he was very\n    fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I've been turning\n    the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible\n    to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little\n    things showed it; he never goes with Flo, always gets on my side\n    of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we\n    are alone, and frowns at any one else who ventures to speak to\n    me. Yesterday, at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us,\n    and then said something to his friend,--a rakish-looking\n    baron,--about '_ein wonderschönes Blöndchen_,' Fred looked as\n    fierce as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely, it nearly flew\n    off his plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but\n    is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might\n    guess from his bonnie blue eyes.\n\n    \"Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset,--at\n    least all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there, after going\n    to the Post Restante for letters. We had a charming time poking\n    about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the\n    beautiful gardens made by the elector, long ago, for his English\n    wife. I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine;\n    so, while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there\n    trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with\n    scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I'd got\n    into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling\n    through the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band\n    below, and waiting for my lover, like a real story-book girl. I\n    had a feeling that something was going to happen, and I was\n    ready for it. I didn't feel blushy\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NASSAU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unknown organization related to baths)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BADEN-BADEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unknown organization related to gambling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANK<|>PERSON<|>Person mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATE<|>PERSON<|>Person mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKFORT<|>GEO<|>City mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOETHE<|>PERSON<|>Famous German writer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHILLER<|>PERSON<|>Famous German writer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANNECKER<|>PERSON<|>Famous sculptor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARIADNE<|>EVENT<|>Unknown event related to a sculpture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Person mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRED<|>PERSON<|>Person mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER<|>PERSON<|>Person mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURENCES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unknown organization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Person mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Person mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRIAN<|>PERSON<|>Person mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARON<|>PERSON<|>Person mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTCH<|>GEO<|>Region mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NECKAR<|>GEO<|>River mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POST RESTANTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unknown organization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTOR<|>PERSON<|>Historical figure mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>KATE<|>Kate mentioned that Frank should marry soon<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>MOTHER<|>Frank is mentioned in relation to his mother<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>FRED<|>Fred is mentioned in relation to Frank<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>MEG<|>Meg is mentioned in relation to Frank<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>JO<|>Jo is mentioned in relation to Frank<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>BETH<|>Beth is mentioned in relation to Frank<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>AUSTRIAN<|>Austrian officer mentioned in relation to Frank<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>BARON<|>Baron mentioned in relation to Frank<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>SCOTCH<|>Frank has Scotch blood in him<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>NECKAR<|>Frank is mentioned in relation to the Neckar river<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>ELECTOR<|>Frank is mentioned in relation to the elector<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
