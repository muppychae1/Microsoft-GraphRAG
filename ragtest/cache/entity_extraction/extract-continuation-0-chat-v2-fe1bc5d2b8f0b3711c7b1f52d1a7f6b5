The moment Aunt March took her nap, or\nwas busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and, curling\nherself up in the easy-chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,\ntravels, and pictures, like a regular book-worm. But, like all\nhappiness, it did not last long; for as sure as she had just reached the\nheart of the story, the sweetest verse of the song, or the most perilous\nadventure of her traveller, a shrill voice called, \"Josy-phine!\nJosy-phine!\" and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the\npoodle, or read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.\n\n          [Illustration: Curling herself up in the big chair]\n\nJo's ambition was to do something very splendid; what it was she had no\nidea, as yet, but left it for time to tell her; and, meanwhile, found\nher greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and\nride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless\nspirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series\nof ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training\nshe received at Aunt March's was just what she needed; and the thought\nthat she was doing something to support herself made her happy, in spite\nof the perpetual \"Josy-phine!\"\n\nBeth was too bashful to go to school; it had been tried, but she\nsuffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home,\nwith her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to\ndevote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went\nfaithfully on by herself, and did the best she could. She was a\nhousewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and\ncomfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be\nloved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little\nworld was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy\nbee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for\nBeth was a child still, and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one\nwhole or handsome one among them; all were outcasts till Beth took them\nin; for, when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her,\nbecause Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the\nmore tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm\ndolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals; no harsh words\nor blows were ever given them; no neglect ever saddened the heart of the\nmost repulsive: but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed, with\nan affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of _dollanity_ had\nbelonged to Jo; and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in\nthe rag-bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth, and\ntaken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat\nlittle cap, and, as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these\ndeficiencies by folding it in a blanket, and devoting her best bed to\nthis chronic invalid. If any one had known the care lavished on that\ndolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they\nlaughed. She brought it bits of bouquets; she read to it, took it out to\nbreathe the air, hidden under her coat; she sung it lullabys, and never\nwent to bed without kissing its dirty face, and whispering tenderly, \"I\nhope you'll have a good night, my poor dear.\"\n\nBeth had her troubles as well as the others; and not being an angel, but\na very human little girl, she often \"wept a little weep,\" as Jo said,\nbecause she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine piano. She loved\nmusic so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practised away so patiently\nat the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if some one (not to\nhint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw\nBeth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn't keep in tune,\nwhen she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work,\nnever was too tired to play for Marmee and the girls, and day after day\nsaid hopefully to herself, \"I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm\ngood.\"\n\nThere are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners\ntill needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the\nsacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the\nsweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.\n\nIf anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she\nwould have answered at once, \"My nose.\" When she was a baby, Jo had\naccidentally dropped her into the coal-hod, and Amy insisted that the\nfall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big, nor red, like poor\n\"Petrea's\"; it was only rather flat, and all\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUNT MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Aunt March is a character in the text who takes naps and keeps Jo busy with tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character in the text who loves reading and has a quick temper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELSHAM'S ESSAYS<|>EVENT<|>A book that Jo reads for hours at a time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is a character in the text who is shy, loves music, and takes care of dolls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANNAH<|>PERSON<|>Hannah is a character in the text who helps keep the home neat and comfortable)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a character in the text who is self-conscious about her nose)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>AUNT MARCH<|>Jo spends time in the library when Aunt March is napping or busy with company<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>BELSHAM'S ESSAYS<|>Jo reads Belsham's Essays for hours at a time<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>HANNAH<|>Beth helps Hannah keep the home neat and comfortable<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>DOLLS<|>Beth takes care of dolls and sets up a hospital for them<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>JO<|>Amy's nose was accidentally affected by Jo when they were younger<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
