But the\n\"up again and take another\" spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack; so\nshe scrambled up, on the shady side this time, and got more booty, but\nnearly left behind her what was far more precious than the money-bags.\n\nShe took to writing sensation stories; for in those dark ages, even\nall-perfect America read rubbish. She told no one, but concocted a\n\"thrilling tale,\" and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor\nof the \"Weekly Volcano.\" She had never read \"Sartor Resartus,\" but she\nhad a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful\nover many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. So she\ndressed herself in her best, and, trying to persuade herself that she\nwas neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and\ndirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of\ncigar-smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their\nheels rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of\nthem took the trouble to remove on her appearance. Somewhat daunted by\nthis reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much\nembarrassment,--\n\n\"Excuse me, I was looking for the 'Weekly Volcano' office; I wished to\nsee Mr. Dashwood.\"\n\nDown went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman,\nand, carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers, he advanced,\nwith a nod, and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep. Feeling\nthat she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her\nmanuscript, and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,\nblundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the\noccasion.\n\n\"A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as an\nexperiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more if this\nsuits.\"\n\nWhile she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,\nand was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers, and\ncasting critical glances up and down the neat pages.\n\n\"Not a first attempt, I take it?\" observing that the pages were\nnumbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon,--sure\nsign of a novice.\n\n\"No, sir; she has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in the\n'Blarneystone Banner.'\"\n\n\"Oh, did she?\" and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to\ntake note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the\nbuttons on her boots. \"Well, you can leave it, if you like. We've more\nof this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present;\nbut I'll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.\"\n\nNow, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her at\nall; but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but\nbow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was\napt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both; for it was\nperfectly evident, from the knowing glances exchanged among the\ngentlemen, that her little fiction of \"my friend\" was considered a good\njoke; and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as\nhe closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never to\nreturn, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching\npinafores vigorously; and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh\nover the scene, and long for next week.\n\nWhen she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced; Mr.\nDashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable; and Mr.\nDashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners:\nso the second interview was much more comfortable than the first.\n\n\"We'll take this\" (editors never say I), \"if you don't object to a few\nalterations. It's too long, but omitting the passages I've marked will\nmake it just the right length,\" he said, in a business-like tone.\n\nJo hardly knew her own MS. again, so crumpled and underscored were its\npages and paragraphs; but, feeling as a tender parent might on being\nasked to cut off her baby's legs in order that it might fit into a new\ncradle, she looked at the marked passages, and was surprised to find\nthat all the moral reflections--which she had carefully put in as\nballast for much romance--had been stricken out.\n\n\"But, sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I\ntook care to have a few of my sinners repent.\"\n\nMr. Dashwood's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had\nforgotten her \"friend,\" and spoken as only an author could.\n\n\"People want to be amused, not preached at, you know. Morals don't sell\nnowadays;\" which was not quite a correct statement, by the way.\n\n\"You think it would do with these alterations, then?\"\n\n\"Yes; it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language good, and so\non,\" was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply.\n\n\"What do you--that is, what compensation--\" began Jo, not exactly\nknowing how\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a writer of sensation stories and aspiring author)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACK<|>PERSON<|>Jack is mentioned as having a similar spirit to Jo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
