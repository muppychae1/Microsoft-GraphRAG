See page 236 of the 1869\nnovel.\n\nOn page 209, \"turnovers\" was replaced with \"turn-overs\". See page 246 of\nthe 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 214, the single quotation mark before \"Head Nurse of Ward\" was\nreplaced with a double quotation mark. See page 252 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 218, \"Year's ago\" was replaced with \"Years ago\". See page 257 of\nthe 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 219, \"ask him so help\" was replaced with \"ask him to help\". See\npage 257 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 219, add period after \"give it to her.\" See page 258 of the 1869\nnovel. \n\nOn page 230, \"two, A.M.\" is spelled the same way, with the comma, in\nthis book and in the 1869 novel (on page 272). The comma was retained.\n\nOn page 244, \"postscrips\" was replaced with \"postscripts\". See page 287\nof the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 279, place exclamation point after won't in 'No, I won't!' See\npage 329 in the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 286, \"actingly\" was replaced with \"acting\". See page 337 of the\n1869 novel.\n\nOn page 288, add comma after mankind in the clause \"who felt at peace\nwith all mankind even his mischievous pupil.\" See page 339 of the 1869\nnovel.\n\nOn page 294, transcribe gray-headed with the hyphen.

The sentence appears the same way on page 10 of the 1869 novel. \n\nChecked the clause \"People who hire all these things done for them never\nknow what they lose\" on page 298. The sentence has a comma after them,\nbut is otherwise written the same way on page 11 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 299, transcribe door-handles with the hyphen.

We\nmade no change, and only point this out because quinny-dingles is such a\nmemorable word that those intimate with the novel may notice the change.\n\nOn page 353, change snowbank to snow-bank. See page 79 of the 1869\nnovel.\n\nOn page 363, a double quotation mark was added before \"Cross-patch, draw\nthe latch\".

In the 1869 novel, the mark\nis a semi-colon (see page 126). We used the semi-colon.\n\nOn page 396, the second line of the verse beginning with \"'Out upon\nyou,\" is indented. In the 1869 version, the capital B of \"Bold-faced\njig!'\" is lined-up under Out. We aligned the verse as the 1869 version\nof the novel--see page 131.\n\nOn page 404, add period after heaviness. See page 140 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 405, transcribe needle-work with the hyphen. See page 141 of the\n1869 book.\n\nOn Page 411, a letter is curiously addressed to Betsey, both here and on\npage 148 of the 1869 book. \n\nOn Page 413, removed double quotes around Yes in \"Yes,\" they say to one\nanother, these so kind ladies. Instead, place a single quote in front of\nYes, because Bhaer is resuming his quote. The resumed quote concludes\nwith a single quote after me and mine. See page 151 of the 1869 novel.\nThe double quote before 'he is a stupid old fellow' is actually a\ntriple-nested quote, ending in make themselves.\n\nOn page 417, transcribe Teddy-ism as Teddyism.
