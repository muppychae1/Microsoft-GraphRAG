I wonder if I should blossom\nout half as well as you have, if I tried it?\" said Jo, as she\nconstructed a kite for Demi, in the topsy-turvy nursery.\n\n\"It's just what you need to bring out the tender, womanly half of your\nnature, Jo. You are like a chestnut-burr, prickly outside, but\nsilky-soft within, and a sweet kernel, if one can only get at it. Love\nwill make you show your heart some day, and then the rough burr will\nfall off.\"\n\n\"Frost opens chestnut-burrs, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to bring\nthem down. Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by them,\"\nreturned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would\never carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.\n\nMeg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old spirit, but\nshe felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her\npower; and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of\nMeg's most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.\nGrief is the best opener for some hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for\nthe bag: a little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's\nimpatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the\nburr, and find the kernel sound and sweet. If she had suspected this,\nshe would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever;\nfortunately she wasn't thinking about herself, so, when the time came,\ndown she dropped.\n\nNow, if she had been the heroine of a moral story-book, she ought at\nthis period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the\nworld, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in\nher pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine; she was only a struggling\nhuman girl, like hundreds of others, and she just acted out her nature,\nbeing sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood suggested. It's\nhighly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do it all at once,\nand it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together,\nbefore some of us even get our feet set in the right way. Jo had got so\nfar, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did\nnot; but to do it cheerfully--ah, that was another thing! She had often\nsaid she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard; and now\nshe had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to devote her\nlife to father and mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they\nhad to her? And, if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor\nof the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than\nto give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for\nothers?\n\nProvidence had taken her at her word; here was the task, not what she\nhad expected, but better, because self had no part in it: now, could she\ndo it? She decided that she would try; and, in her first attempt, she\nfound the helps I have suggested. Still another was given her, and she\ntook it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the\nrefreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed\nthe hill called Difficulty.\n\n\"Why don't you write? That always used to make you happy,\" said her\nmother, once, when the desponding fit overshadowed Jo.\n\n\"I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things.\"\n\n\"We do; write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world.\nTry it, dear; I'm sure it would do you good, and please us very much.\"\n\n\"Don't believe I can;\" but Jo got out her desk, and began to overhaul\nher half-finished manuscripts.\n\nAn hour afterward her mother peeped in, and there she was, scratching\naway, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which\ncaused Mrs. March to smile, and slip away, well pleased with the success\nof her suggestion. Jo never knew how it happened, but something got into\nthat story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it; for,\nwhen her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it, much\nagainst her will, to one of the popular magazines, and, to her utter\nsurprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested. Letters from\nseveral persons, whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the\nlittle story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends\nadmired it. For a small thing it was a great success; and Jo was more\nastonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once.\n\n\"I don't understand it. What _can_ there be in a simple little story\nlike that, to make people praise it so?\" she said, quite bewildered.\n\n\"There is truth in it, Jo, that's\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
