It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the\ncordial tone in which she said,--\n\n\"I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I\nfancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost\nyour heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into some\nof the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a\nforeign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun; come and lie on the grass\nhere, and 'let us be friendly,' as Jo used to say when we got in the\nsofa-corner and told secrets.\"\n\n         [Illustration: Laurie threw himself down on the turf]\n\nLaurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse\nhimself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay\nthere.\n\n\"I'm all ready for the secrets;\" and he glanced up with a decided\nexpression of interest in his eyes.\n\n\"I've none to tell; you may begin.\"\n\n\"Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd had some news\nfrom home.\"\n\n\"You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often? I\nfancied Jo would send you volumes.\"\n\n\"She's very busy; I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular,\nyou know. When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?\" he\nasked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he\nhad been wondering if Amy knew his secret, and wanted to talk about it.\n\n\"Never,\" she answered, with a despondent but decided air. \"Rome took all\nthe vanity out of me; for after seeing the wonders there, I felt too\ninsignificant to live, and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.\"\n\n\"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?\"\n\n\"That's just why,--because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy\ncan make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a\ncommon-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?\"\n\n\"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get the\nchance.\"\n\nIt was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring; but audacity becomes\nyoung people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation. Laurie smiled,\nbut he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a\nlong-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.\n\n\"Good! and here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.\"\n\nAmy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her\ndowncast face, that made Laurie sit up and say gravely,--\n\n\"Now I'm going to play brother, and ask questions. May I?\"\n\n\"I don't promise to answer.\"\n\n\"Your face will, if your tongue won't. You aren't woman of the world\nenough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors about Fred and\nyou last year, and it's my private opinion that, if he had not been\ncalled home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come\nof it--hey?\"\n\n\"That's not for me to say,\" was Amy's prim reply; but her lips would\nsmile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye, which betrayed\nthat she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.\n\n\"You are not engaged, I hope?\" and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly\nand grave all of a sudden.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down upon his\nknees, won't you?\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"Then you are fond of old Fred?\"\n\n\"I could be, if I tried.\"\n\n\"But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul, what\nunearthly prudence! He's a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I fancied\nyou'd like.\"\n\n\"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,\" began Amy, trying\nto be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of herself,\nin spite of the sincerity of her intentions.\n\n\"I understand; queens of society can't get on without money, so you mean\nto make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right and proper, as\nthe world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother's\ngirls.\"\n\n\"True, nevertheless.\"\n\nA short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered\ncontrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this\ninstinctively, and laid himself down again, with a sense of\ndisappointment which he could not explain. His look and silence, as well\nas a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her resolve\nto deliver her lecture without delay.\n\n\"I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,\" she said\nsharply.\n\n\"Do it for me, there's a dear girl.\"\n\n\"I could, if I tried;\" and she looked as if she would like doing it in\nthe most summary style.\n\n\"Try, then\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
