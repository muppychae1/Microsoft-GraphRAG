I never wanted to go away, and\nthe hard part now is the leaving you all. I'm not afraid, but it seems\nas if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.\"\n\nJo could not speak; and for several minutes there was no sound but the\nsigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide. A white-winged gull flew\nby, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast; Beth watched it\ntill it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness. A little\ngray-coated sand-bird came tripping over the beach, \"peeping\" softly to\nitself, as if enjoying the sun and sea; it came quite close to Beth,\nlooked at her with a friendly eye, and sat upon a warm stone, dressing\nits wet feathers, quite at home. Beth smiled, and felt comforted, for\nthe tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship, and remind her that\na pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.\n\n\"Dear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is. I like peeps better than the\ngulls: they are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy, confiding\nlittle things. I used to call them my birds, last summer; and mother\nsaid they reminded her of me,--busy, quaker-colored creatures, always\nnear the shore, and always chirping that contented little song of\ntheirs. You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the\nwind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone. Meg is the\nturtle-dove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up\namong the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again. Dear\nlittle girl! she's so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender; and\nno matter how high she flies, she never will forget home. I hope I shall\nsee her again, but she seems _so_ far away.\"\n\n\"She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to\nsee and enjoy her. I'm going to have you well and rosy by that time,\"\nbegan Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change\nwas the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought\naloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.\n\n\"Jo, dear, don't hope any more; it won't do any good, I'm sure of that.\nWe won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait. We'll\nhave happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I think the tide will go\nout easily, if you help me.\"\n\nJo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face; and with that silent kiss, she\ndedicated herself soul and body to Beth.\n\nShe was right: there was no need of any words when they got home, for\nfather and mother saw plainly, now, what they had prayed to be saved\nfrom seeing. Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed,\nsaying how glad she was to be at home; and when Jo went down, she found\nthat she would be spared the hard task of telling Beth's secret. Her\nfather stood leaning his head on the mantel-piece, and did not turn as\nshe came in; but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and\nJo went to comfort her without a word.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n             [Illustration: He hurried forward to meet her]\n\n                                XXXVII.\n\n                            NEW IMPRESSIONS.\n\n\nAt three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice may\nbe seen on the Promenade des Anglais,--a charming place; for the wide\nwalk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is bounded on\none side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined with hotels\nand villas, while beyond lie orange-orchards and the hills. Many nations\nare represented, many languages spoken, many costumes worn; and, on a\nsunny day, the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival. Haughty\nEnglish, lively French, sober Germans, handsome Spaniards, ugly\nRussians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all drive, sit, or saunter\nhere, chatting over the news, and criticising the latest celebrity who\nhas arrived,--Ristori or Dickens, Victor Emmanuel or the Queen of the\nSandwich Islands. The equipages are as varied as the company, and\nattract as much attention, especially the low basket-barouches in which\nladies drive themselves, with a pair of dashing ponies, gay nets to keep\ntheir voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and\nlittle grooms on the perch behind.\n\nAlong this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with\nhis hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance.\nHe looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the\nindependent air of an American,--a combination which caused sundry pairs\nof feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in\nblack velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and\norange-flowers in their button-holes, to shrug their shoulders, and then\nenvy him his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but\nthe young man took little notice of them, except to glance, now and\nthen, at some blonde girl, or lady in blue.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NICE<|>GEO<|>City where the fashionable world gathers on the Promenade des Anglais)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS<|>GEO<|>A charming walk in Nice bordered by palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN<|>GEO<|>Nationality of a young man walking on the Promenade des Anglais)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLISHMAN<|>GEO<|>Dress style of the young man walking on the Promenade des Anglais)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN<|>GEO<|>Independent air of the young man walking on the Promenade des Anglais)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISTORI<|>PERSON<|>Celebrity mentioned in the fashionable world at Nice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DICKENS<|>PERSON<|>Celebrity mentioned in the fashionable world at Nice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICTOR EMMANUEL<|>PERSON<|>Celebrity mentioned in the fashionable world at Nice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUEEN OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS<|>PERSON<|>Celebrity mentioned in the fashionable world at Nice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTMAS DAY<|>EVENT<|>Day when a tall young man walked on the Promenade des Anglais)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITALIAN<|>PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS<|>The young man walking on the Promenade des Anglais looks like an Italian<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENGLISHMAN<|>PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS<|>The young man walking on the Promenade des Anglais is dressed like an Englishman<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERICAN<|>PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS<|>The young man walking on the Promenade des Anglais has an independent air like an American<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISTORI<|>PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS<|>Ristori is a celebrity mentioned in the fashionable world at Nice<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DICKENS<|>PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS<|>Dickens is a celebrity mentioned in the fashionable world at Nice<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR EMMANUEL<|>PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS<|>Victor Emmanuel is a celebrity mentioned in the fashionable world at Nice<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS<|>PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS<|>The Queen of the Sandwich Islands is a celebrity mentioned in the fashionable world at Nice<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTMAS DAY<|>PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS<|>A tall young man walked on the Promenade des Anglais on Christmas Day<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
