Will you, lovey?\"\n\n\"Iss!\" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the\ndesired day.\n\nTaking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away, and ran\ndown to greet her husband with a smiling face, and the little blue bow\nin her hair which was his especial admiration. He saw it at once, and\nsaid, with pleased surprise,--\n\n\"Why, little mother, how gay we are to-night. Do you expect company?\"\n\n\"Only you, dear.\"\n\n\"Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?\"\n\n\"No; I'm tired of being a dowdy, so I dressed up as a change. You always\nmake yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are; so why\nshouldn't I when I have the time?\"\n\n\"I do it out of respect to you, my dear,\" said old-fashioned John.\n\n\"Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,\" laughed Meg, looking young and pretty again,\nas she nodded to him over the teapot.\n\n\"Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times. This tastes\nright. I drink your health, dear.\" And John sipped his tea with an air\nof reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration, however; for, as\nhe put down his cup, the door-handle rattled mysteriously, and a little\nvoice was heard, saying impatiently,--\n\n\"Opy doy; me's tummin!\"\n\n\"It's that naughty boy. I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he is,\ndownstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas,\" said\nMeg, answering the call.\n\n                      [Illustration: Mornin' now]\n\n\"Mornin' now,\" announced Demi, in a joyful tone, as he entered, with his\nlong night-gown gracefully festooned over his arm, and every curl\nbobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eying the \"cakies\" with\nloving glances.\n\n\"No, it isn't morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble poor\nmamma; then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.\"\n\n\"Me loves parpar,\" said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal\nknee, and revel in forbidden joys. But John shook his head, and said to\nMeg,--\n\n\"If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do\nit, or he will never learn to mind you.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. Come, Demi;\" and Meg led her son away, feeling a\nstrong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,\nlaboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as\nsoon as they reached the nursery.\n\nNor was he disappointed; for that short-sighted woman actually gave him\na lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more\npromenades till morning.\n\n\"Iss!\" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and\nregarding his first attempt as eminently successful.\n\nMeg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when\nthe little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies by\nboldly demanding,--\n\n\"More sudar, marmar.\"\n\n\"Now this won't do,\" said John, hardening his heart against the engaging\nlittle sinner. \"We shall never know any peace till that child learns to\ngo to bed properly. You have made a slave of yourself long enough; give\nhim one lesson, and then there will be an end of it. Put him in his bed\nand leave him, Meg.\"\n\n\"He won't stay there; he never does, unless I sit by him.\"\n\n\"I'll manage him. Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as mamma\nbids you.\"\n\n\"S'ant!\" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted\n\"cakie,\" and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.\n\n\"You must never say that to papa; I shall carry you if you don't go\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Go 'way; me don't love parpar;\" and Demi retired to his mother's skirts\nfor protection.\n\nBut even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to the\nenemy, with a \"Be gentle with him, John,\" which struck the culprit with\ndismay; for when mamma deserted him, then the judgment-day was at hand.\nBereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a strong\nhand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his wrath, but\nopenly defied papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the way\nupstairs. The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled out on\nthe other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously caught up by\nthe tail of his little toga, and put back again, which lively\nperformance was kept up till the young man's strength gave out, when he\ndevoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice. This vocal exercise\nusually conquered Meg; but John sat as unmoved as the post which is\npopularly believed to be deaf.
