She put it away; but it haunted her, not\ndelightfully, as a new dress should, but dreadfully, like the ghost of a\nfolly that was not easily laid. When John got out his books that night,\nMeg's heart sank, and for the first time in her married life, she was\nafraid of her husband. The kind, brown eyes looked as if they could be\nstern; and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had found her\nout, but didn't mean to let her know it. The house-bills were all paid,\nthe books all in order. John had praised her, and was undoing the old\npocket-book which they called the \"bank,\" when Meg, knowing that it was\nquite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously,--\n\n\"You haven't seen my private expense book yet.\"\n\nJohn never asked to see it; but she always insisted on his doing so, and\nused to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted,\nand made him guess what \"piping\" was, demand fiercely the meaning of a\n\"hug-me-tight,\" or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds,\na bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a bonnet, and\ncost five or six dollars. That night he looked as if he would like the\nfun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her\nextravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent\nwife.\n\nThe little book was brought slowly out, and laid down before him. Meg\ngot behind his chair under pretence of smoothing the wrinkles out of his\ntired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic increasing\nwith every word,--\n\n\"John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really been\ndreadfully extravagant lately. I go about so much I must have things,\nyou know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did; and my New-Year's\nmoney will partly pay for it: but I was sorry after I'd done it, for I\nknew you'd think it wrong in me.\"\n\nJohn laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying good-humoredly,\n\"Don't go and hide. I won't beat you if you _have_ got a pair of killing\nboots; I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she does\npay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones.\"\n\nThat had been one of her last \"trifles,\" and John's eye had fallen on it\nas he spoke. \"Oh, what _will_ he say when he comes to that awful fifty\ndollars!\" thought Meg, with a shiver.\n\n\"It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress,\" she said, with the calmness\nof desperation, for she wanted the worst over.\n\n\"Well, dear, what is the 'dem'd total,' as Mr. Mantalini says?\"\n\nThat didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with\nthe straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and\nanswer with one as frank till now. She turned the page and her head at\nthe same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough\nwithout the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added. For a\nminute the room was very still; then John said slowly,--but she could\nfeel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure,--\n\n\"Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the\nfurbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days.\"\n\n\"It isn't made or trimmed,\" sighed Meg faintly, for a sudden\nrecollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.\n\n\"Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman,\nbut I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's when she\ngets it on,\" said John dryly.\n\n\"I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it. I don't mean to waste\nyour money, and I didn't think those little things would count up so. I\ncan't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and pitying me\nbecause I don't. I try to be contented, but it is hard, and I'm tired of\nbeing poor.\"\n\nThe last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but\nhe did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many\npleasures for Meg's sake. She could have bitten her tongue out the\nminute she had said it, for John pushed the books away, and got up,\nsaying, with a little quiver in his voice, \"I was afraid of this; I do\nmy best, Meg.\" If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not\nhave broken her heart like those\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
