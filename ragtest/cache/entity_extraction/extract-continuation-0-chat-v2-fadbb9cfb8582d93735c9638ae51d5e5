I'll give him a hearty scolding, and bring him over\nto beg pardon,\" cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice. But her\nmother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore,--\n\n\"Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played so many\npranks, that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.\"\n\n\"On my word, mother, I haven't! I never saw that note before, and don't\nknow anything about it, as true as I live!\" said Jo, so earnestly that\nthey believed her. \"If I _had_ taken a part in it I'd have done it\nbetter than this, and have written a sensible note. I should think you'd\nhave known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff as that,\" she added,\nscornfully tossing down the paper.\n\n\"It's like his writing,\" faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in her\nhand.\n\n\"O Meg, you didn't answer it?\" cried Mrs. March quickly.\n\n\"Yes, I did!\" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.\n\n\"Here's a scrape! _Do_ let me bring that wicked boy over to explain, and\nbe lectured. I can't rest till I get hold of him;\" and Jo made for the\ndoor again.\n\n\"Hush! let me manage this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret,\ntell me the whole story,\" commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg, yet\nkeeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.\n\n\"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew\nanything about it,\" began Meg, without looking up. \"I was worried at\nfirst, and meant to tell you; then I remembered how you liked Mr.\nBrooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a\nfew days. I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew; and, while I\nwas deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such\nthings to do. Forgive me, mother, I'm paid for my silliness now; I never\ncan look him in the face again.\"\n\n\"What did you say to him?\" asked Mrs. March.\n\n\"I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet; that I didn't\nwish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father. I was very\ngrateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more,\nfor a long while.\"\n\nMrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,\nexclaiming, with a laugh,--\n\n\"You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who was a pattern of prudence!\nTell on, Meg. What did he say to that?\"\n\n\"He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent\nany love-letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,\nshould take such liberties with our names. It's very kind and\nrespectful, but think how dreadful for me!\"\n\nMeg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo\ntramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden she\nstopped, caught up the two notes, and, after looking at them closely,\nsaid decidedly, \"I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these\nletters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with, because\nI wouldn't tell him my secret.\"\n\n\"Don't have any secrets, Jo; tell it to mother, and keep out of trouble,\nas I should have done,\" said Meg warningly.\n\n\"Bless you, child! Mother told me.\"\n\n\"That will do, Jo. I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie. I shall\nsift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at once.\"\n\nAway ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real feelings.\n\"Now, dear, what are your own? Do you love him enough to wait till he\ncan make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the\npresent?\"\n\n\"I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do\nwith lovers for a long while,--perhaps never,\" answered Meg petulantly.\n\"If John _doesn't_ know anything about this nonsense, don't tell him,\nand make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won't be deceived and\nplagued and made a fool of,--it's a shame!\"\n\nSeeing that Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by\nthis mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire\nsilence, and great discretion for the future. The instant Laurie's step\nwas heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received\nthe culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he\nwouldn't come; but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and\nstood twirling his hat, with a guilty air which convicted him at once.\nJo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a\nsentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. The sound of\nvoices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour; but what happened\nduring that interview the girls never knew.\n\nWhen they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother, with such\na penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHN<|>PERSON<|>John is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
