Ah me! such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching\nhearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced\nto see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the\nbitter cry, \"Help me, help me!\" and to feel that there was no help. A\nsad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with\ndeath; but both were mercifully brief, and then, the natural rebellion\nover, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck of\nher frail body, Beth's soul grew strong; and, though she said little,\nthose about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim\ncalled was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,\ntrying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed\nthe river.\n\nJo never left her for an hour since Beth had said, \"I feel stronger when\nyou are here.\" She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew\nthe fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom\nasked for anything, and \"tried not to be a trouble.\" All day she haunted\nthe room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then\nthan of any honor her life ever brought her. Precious and helpful hours\nto Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it needed; lessons\nin patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn\nthem; charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly\nforget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy, and\nthe sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly.\n\nOften, when she woke, Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little\nbook, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw\nher lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the\ntransparent fingers; and Jo would lie watching her, with thoughts too\ndeep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was\ntrying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the\nlife to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music\nshe loved so well.\n\nSeeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest\nhymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter; for, with\neyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest\nsorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life,--uneventful,\nunambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which \"smell sweet, and\nblossom in the dust,\" the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on\nearth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible\nto all.\n\nOne night, when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find\nsomething to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as\nhard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite\nPilgrim's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo's\nhand. The name caught her eye, and the blurred look of the lines made\nher sure that tears had fallen on it.\n\n\"Poor Jo! she's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave; she shows\nme all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I look at this,\"\nthought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug, with the\ntongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.\n\n\n                               \"MY BETH.\n\n        \"Sitting patient in the shadow\n           Till the blessed light shall come,\n         A serene and saintly presence\n           Sanctifies our troubled home.\n         Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows\n           Break like ripples on the strand\n         Of the deep and solemn river\n           Where her willing feet now stand.\n\n        \"O my sister, passing from me,\n           Out of human care and strife,\n         Leave me, as a gift, those virtues\n           Which have beautified your life.\n         Dear, bequeath me that great patience\n           Which has power to sustain\n         A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit\n           In its prison-house of pain.\n\n        \"Give me, for I need it sorely,\n           Of that courage, wise and sweet,\n         Which has made the path of duty\n           Green beneath your willing feet.\n         Give me that unselfish nature,\n           That with charity divine\n         Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake--\n           Meek heart, forgive me mine!\n\n        \"Thus our parting daily loseth\n          Something of its bitter pain,\n         And while learning this hard lesson,\n           My great loss becomes my gain.\n         For the touch of grief will render\n           My wild nature more serene,\n         Give to life new aspirations,\n           A new trust in the unseen.\n\n        \"Henceforth, safe across the river,\n           I shall see forevermore\n         A beloved, household spirit\n           Waiting for me on the shore.\n         Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,\n           Guardian angels shall become,\n         And the sister gone before me\n           By their hands shall lead me home.\"\n\nBlurred and blotted, faulty and feeble, as the lines were, they brought\na look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one regret had\nbeen that she\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is a young woman who is ill and nearing the end of her life, showing strength and peace in her final days)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is Beth's sister who cares for her during her illness, learning important life lessons in the process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PILGRIM'S PROGRESS<|>EVENT<|>A book that brings comfort to Beth during her illness)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>JO<|>Beth and Jo share a close sisterly bond, with Jo caring for Beth during her illness<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>PILGRIM'S PROGRESS<|>Beth finds comfort in reading Pilgrim's Progress during her illness<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>PILGRIM'S PROGRESS<|>Jo introduces Beth to Pilgrim's Progress as a source of comfort<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
