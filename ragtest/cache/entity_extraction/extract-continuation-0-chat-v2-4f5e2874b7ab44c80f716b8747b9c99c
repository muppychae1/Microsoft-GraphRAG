Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined\nto find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who\nnever refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, \"Do tell me! I\nshould think you might let me go, too; for Beth is fussing over her\npiano, and I haven't got anything to do, and am _so_ lonely.\"\n\n\"I can't, dear, because you aren't invited,\" began Meg; but Jo broke in\nimpatiently, \"Now, Meg, be quiet, or you will spoil it all. You can't\ngo, Amy; so don't be a baby, and whine about it.\"\n\n\"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are; you were\nwhispering and laughing together, on the sofa, last night, and you\nstopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are; now do be still, and stop bothering.\"\n\nAmy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her\npocket.\n\n\"I know! I know! you're going to the theatre to see the 'Seven\nCastles!'\" she cried; adding resolutely, \"and I _shall_ go, for mother\nsaid I might see it; and I've got my rag-money, and it was mean not to\ntell me in time.\"\n\n\"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,\" said Meg soothingly.\n\"Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not well\nenough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. Next week you can go\nwith Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.\"\n\n\"I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please let\nme; I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying for\nsome fun. Do, Meg! I'll be ever so good,\" pleaded Amy, looking as\npathetic as she could.\n\n\"Suppose we take her. I don't believe mother would mind, if we bundle\nher up well,\" began Meg.\n\n\"If _she_ goes _I_ sha'n't; and if I don't, Laurie won't like it; and it\nwill be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I\nshould think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't wanted,\" said Jo\ncrossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child,\nwhen she wanted to enjoy herself.\n\nHer tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,\nin her most aggravating way, \"I _shall_ go; Meg says I may; and if I pay\nfor myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn't sit\nalone; so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our\npleasure; or he'll get another seat for you, and that isn't proper, when\nyou weren't asked. You sha'n't stir a step; so you may just stay where\nyou are,\" scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her finger\nin her hurry.\n\nSitting on the floor, with one boot on, Amy began to cry, and Meg to\nreason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls\nhurried down, leaving their sister wailing; for now and then she forgot\nher grown-up ways, and acted like a spoilt child. Just as the party was\nsetting out, Amy called over the banisters, in a threatening tone,\n\"You'll be sorry for this, Jo March; see if you ain't.\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" returned Jo, slamming the door.\n\nThey had a charming time, for \"The Seven Castles of the Diamond Lake\"\nwere as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But, in spite of\nthe comical red imps, sparkling elves, and gorgeous princes and\nprincesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it; the fairy\nqueen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy; and between the acts she\namused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her\n\"sorry for it.\" She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course\nof their lives, for both had quick tempers, and were apt to be violent\nwhen fairly roused\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a young girl who is part of a family with sisters Jo, Meg, and Beth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
