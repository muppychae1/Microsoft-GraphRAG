Of course, Demi\ntyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other\naggressor; while Daisy made a galley-slave of herself, and adored her\nbrother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny\nlittle soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and\nnestled there. One of the captivating children, who seem made to be\nkissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and\nproduced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small\nvirtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few\nsmall naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair\nweather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window\nin her little night-gown to look out, and say, no matter whether it\nrained or shone, \"Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!\" Every one was a friend,\nand she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most\ninveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful\nworshippers.\n\n                   [Illustration: Me loves evvybody]\n\n\"Me loves evvybody,\" she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in\none hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish\nthe whole world.\n\nAs she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dove-cote would be blest\nby the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had\nhelped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared\na loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had\nentertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often called her \"Beth,\"\nand her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as if\ntrying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could\nsee.\n\nDemi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know\neverything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get\nsatisfactory answers to his perpetual \"What for?\"\n\nHe also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his\ngrandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which\nthe precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised\nsatisfaction of the womenfolk.\n\n             [Illustration: What makes my legs go, dranpa?]\n\n\"What makes my legs go, dranpa?\" asked the young philosopher, surveying\nthose active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting\nafter a go-to-bed frolic one night.\n\n\"It's your little mind, Demi,\" replied the sage, stroking the yellow\nhead respectfully.\n\n\"What is a little mine?\"\n\n\"It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the\nwheels go in my watch when I showed it to you.\"\n\n\"Open me; I want to see it go wound.\"\n\n\"I can't do that any more than you could open the watch. God winds you\nup, and you go till He stops you.\"\n\n\"Does I?\" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the\nnew thought. \"Is I wounded up like the watch?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I can't show you how; for it is done when we don't see.\"\n\nDemi felt of his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the\nwatch, and then gravely remarked,--\n\n\"I dess Dod does it when I's asleep.\"\n\nA careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively that\nhis anxious grandmother said,--\n\n\"My dear, do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby?\nHe's getting great bumps over his eyes, and learning to ask the most\nunanswerable questions.\"\n\n\"If he is old enough to ask the questions he is old enough to receive\ntrue answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping\nhim unfold those already there. These children are wiser than we are,\nand I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him.\nNow, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind?\"\n\nIf the boy had replied like Alcibiades, \"By the gods, Socrates, I cannot\ntell,\" his grandfather would not have been surprised; but when, after\nstanding a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he\nanswered, in a tone of calm conviction, \"In my little belly,\" the old\ngentleman could only join in grandma's laugh, and dismiss the class in\nmetaphysics.\n\nThere might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given\nconvincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
