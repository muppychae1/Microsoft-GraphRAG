Am I? Can\nyou make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?\" he added, all in\none breath.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Jo; and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both\nhands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that plainly\nshowed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him, even\nthough she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he carried\nit.\n\nIt was certainly proposing under difficulties, for, even if he had\ndesired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on account\nof the mud; neither could he offer Jo his hand, except figuratively, for\nboth were full; much less could he indulge in tender demonstrations in\nthe open street, though he was near it: so the only way in which he\ncould express his rapture was to look at her, with an expression which\nglorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be\nlittle rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard. If he had not\nloved Jo very much, I don't think he could have done it _then_, for she\nlooked far from lovely, with her skirts in a deplorable state, her\nrubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her bonnet a ruin. Fortunately,\nMr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living, and she found\nhim more \"Jove-like\" than ever, though his hat-brim was quite limp with\nthe little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the\numbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves needed mending.\n\nPassers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they\nentirely forgot to hail a 'bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious\nof deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what anybody thought, for\nthey were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any\nlife, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the\nplain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven.\nThe Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the world had\nnothing more to offer him in the way of bliss; while Jo trudged beside\nhim, feeling as if her place had always been there, and wondering how\nshe ever could have chosen any other lot. Of course, she was the first\nto speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks which followed\nher impetuous \"Oh, yes!\" were not of a coherent or reportable\ncharacter.\n\n\"Friedrich, why didn't you--\"\n\n\"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!\"\ncried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful\ndelight.\n\n\"I always call you so to myself--I forgot; but I won't, unless you like\nit.\"\n\n\"Like it? it is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say 'thou,' also, and\nI shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.\"\n\n\"Isn't 'thou' a little sentimental?\" asked Jo, privately thinking it a\nlovely monosyllable.\n\n\"Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and keep\nourselves young mit it. Your English 'you' is so cold, say 'thou,'\nheart's dearest, it means so much to me,\" pleaded Mr. Bhaer, more like a\nromantic student than a grave professor.\n\n\"Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?\" asked Jo\nbashfully.\n\n\"Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will,\nbecause thou must take care of it hereafter. See, then, my Jo,--ah, the\ndear, funny little name!--I had a wish to tell something the day I said\ngood-by, in New York; but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to\nthee, and so I spoke not. Wouldst thou have said 'Yes,' then, if I _had_\nspoken?\"\n\n\"I don't know; I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart just then.\"\n\n\"Prut! that I do not believe. It was asleep till the fairy prince came\nthrough the wood, and waked it up. Ah, well, 'Die erste Liebe ist die\nbeste;' but that I should not expect.\"\n\n\"Yes, the first love _is_ the best; so be contented, for I never had\nanother. Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his little fancy,\" said\nJo, anxious to correct the Professor's mistake.\n\n\"Good! then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all. I\nhaf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
