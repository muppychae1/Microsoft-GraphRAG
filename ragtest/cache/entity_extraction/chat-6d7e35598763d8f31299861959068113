The\nlatter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young\npair, and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy. The\nbag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the\nstage, till it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely\nsoftens the \"stern sire\": he consents without a murmur, all join in a\njoyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive\nDon Pedro's blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.\n\n  [Illustration: The lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's blessing]\n\nTumultuous applause followed, but received an unexpected check; for the\ncot-bed, on which the \"dress-circle\" was built, suddenly shut up, and\nextinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to\nthe rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless\nwith laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided, when Hannah appeared,\nwith \"Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk down to\nsupper.\"\n\nThis was a surprise, even to the actors; and, when they saw the table,\nthey looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee to\nget up a little treat for them; but anything so fine as this was\nunheard-of since the departed days of plenty. There was\nice-cream,--actually two dishes of it, pink and white,--and cake and\nfruit and distracting French bonbons, and, in the middle of the table,\nfour great bouquets of hot-house flowers!\n\nIt quite took their breath away; and they stared first at the table and\nthen at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.\n\n\"Is it fairies?\" asked Amy,\n\n\"It's Santa Claus,\" said Beth.\n\n\"Mother did it\"; and Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard\nand white eyebrows.\n\n\"Aunt March had a good fit, and sent the supper,\" cried Jo, with a\nsudden inspiration.\n\n\"All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\" replied Mrs. March.\n\n\"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into\nhis head? We don't know him!\" exclaimed Meg.\n\n\"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an\nodd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father, years ago;\nand he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would\nallow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending\nthem a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse; and so you\nhave a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He's a capital fellow,\nand I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he'd like to know us;\nbut he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him when\nwe pass,\" said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt\nout of sight, with \"Ohs!\" and \"Ahs!\" of satisfaction.\n\n\"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?\"\nasked one of the girls. \"My mother knows old Mr. Laurence; but says he's\nvery proud, and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his\ngrandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor, and\nmakes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn't\ncome. Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.\"\n\n\"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the\nfence, and were getting on capitally,--all about cricket, and so\non,--when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some\nday; for he needs fun, I'm sure he does,\" said Jo decidedly.\n\n                [Illustration: We talked over the fence]\n\n\"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman; so I've no\nobjection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought\nthe flowers himself; and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure\nwhat was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away,\nhearing the frolic, and evidently having none of his own.\"\n\n\"It's a mercy you didn't, mother!\" laughed Jo, looking at her boots.\n\"But we'll have another play, some time, that he _can_ see. Perhaps\nhe'll help act; wouldn't that be jolly?\"\n\n\"I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!\" And Meg\nexamined her flowers with great interest.\n\n\"They _are_ lovely! But Beth's roses are sweeter to me,\" said Mrs.\nMarch, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.\n\nBeth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, \"I wish I could send my\nbunch to father. I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we\nare.\"\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n  [Illustration: Eating apples and crying over the \"Heir of Redclyffe\"]\n\n                                  III.\n\n                           THE LAURENCE BOY.\n\n\n\"Jo!
