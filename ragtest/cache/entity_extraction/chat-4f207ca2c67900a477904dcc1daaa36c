John is above such meanness,\nand I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so,\" cried Meg\nindignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's\nsuspicions. \"My John wouldn't marry for money, anymore than I would. We\nare willing to work, and we mean to wait. I'm not afraid of being poor,\nfor I've been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him, because he\nloves me, and I--\"\n\nMeg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't made up\nher mind; that she had told \"her John\" to go away, and that he might be\noverhearing her inconsistent remarks.\n\nAunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her\npretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's happy young\nface made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.\n\n\"Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a wilful child, and\nyou've lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won't stop;\nI'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits to see your father now.\nDon't expect anything from me when you are married; your Mr. Book's\nfriends must take care of you. I'm done with you forever.\"\n\nAnd, slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in high\ndudgeon. She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her; for, when\nleft alone, Meg stood a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.\nBefore she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr.\nBrooke, who said, all in one breath, \"I couldn't help hearing, Meg.\nThank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you _do_\ncare for me a little bit.\"\n\n\"I didn't know how much, till she abused you,\" began Meg.\n\n\"And I needn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?\"\n\nHere was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately\nexit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced herself\nforever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, \"Yes, John,\" and hiding her\nface on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.\n\nFifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly down\nstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and, hearing no sound\nwithin, nodded and smiled, with a satisfied expression, saying to\nherself, \"She has sent him away as we planned, and that affair is\nsettled. I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it.\"\n\nBut poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the\nthreshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth\nnearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy,\nand to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an\nobjectionable lover, it certainly _was_ a shock to behold the aforesaid\nenemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strong-minded sister\nenthroned upon his knee, and wearing an expression of the most abject\nsubmission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower-bath had\nsuddenly fallen upon her,--for such an unexpected turning of the tables\nactually took her breath away. At the odd sound, the lovers turned and\nsaw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy; but \"that man,\" as\nJo called him, actually laughed, and said coolly, as he kissed the\nastonished new-comer, \"Sister Jo, congratulate us!\"\n\nThat was adding insult to injury,--it was altogether too much,--and,\nmaking some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a\nword. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming\ntragically, as she burst into the room, \"Oh, _do_ somebody go down\nquick; John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!\"\n\nMr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed; and, casting herself upon\nthe bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news\nto Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered it a most\nagreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them; so\nshe went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles to\nthe rats.\n\nNobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon; but a great\ndeal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends by\nthe eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his plans,\nand persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.\n\nThe tea-bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which\nhe meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both\nlooking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy\nwas very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity. Beth\nbeamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the\nyoung couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident\nAunt March was right in calling them as \"unworldly as a pair of babies.\"\nNo one ate much, but every one looked very happy, and the old room\nseemed to brighten up amazingly when the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
