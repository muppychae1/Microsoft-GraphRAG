They were all there, his grandfather,--oh, so proud!--Mr. and Mrs.\nMarch, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him with the\nsincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but fail to win\nfrom the world by any after-triumphs.\n\n\"I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early\nto-morrow; you'll come and meet me as usual, girls?\" Laurie said, as he\nput the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over.\nHe said \"girls,\" but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up\nthe old custom; she had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful\nboy anything, and answered warmly,--\n\n\"I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing '_Hail\nthe conquering hero comes_,' on a jews-harp.\"\n\nLaurie thanked her with a look that made her think, in a sudden panic,\n\"Oh, deary me! I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?\"\n\nEvening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and\nhaving decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people were\ngoing to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her\nanswer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy\nwouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor little feelings. A call\nat Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn,\nstill further fortified her for the _tête-à-tête_, but when she saw a\nstalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn\nabout and run away.\n\n\"Where's the jews-harp, Jo?\" cried Laurie, as soon as he was within\nspeaking distance.\n\n\"I forgot it;\" and Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not be\ncalled lover-like.\n\nShe always used to take his arm on these occasions; now she did not, and\nhe made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly about\nall sorts of far-away subjects, till they turned from the road into the\nlittle path that led homeward through the grove. Then he walked more\nslowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and, now and then, a\ndreadful pause occurred. To rescue the conversation from one of the\nwells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said hastily,--\n\n\"Now you must have a good long holiday!\"\n\n\"I intend to.\"\n\nSomething in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him\nlooking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded\nmoment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring,--\n\n\"No, Teddy, please don't!\"\n\n\"I will, and you _must_ hear me. It's no use, Jo; we've got to have it\nout, and the sooner the better for both of us,\" he answered, getting\nflushed and excited all at once.\n\n\"Say what you like, then; I'll listen,\" said Jo, with a desperate sort\nof patience.\n\nLaurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to \"have it\nout,\" if he died in the attempt; so he plunged into the subject with\ncharacteristic impetuosity, saying in a voice that _would_ get choky now\nand then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady,--\n\n\"I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo; couldn't help it, you've\nbeen so good to me. I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me; now\nI'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I _can't_ go on\nso any longer.\"\n\n\"I wanted to save you this; I thought you'd understand--\" began Jo,\nfinding it a great deal harder than she expected.\n\n\"I know you did; but girls are so queer you never know what they mean.\nThey say No when they mean Yes, and drive a man out of his wits just for\nthe fun of it,\" returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an\nundeniable fact.\n\n\"_I_ don't. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away\nto keep you from it if I could.\"\n\n\"I thought so; it was like you, but it was no use. I only loved you all\nthe more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards and\neverything you didn't like, and waited and never complained, for I hoped\nyou'd love me, though I'm not half good enough--\" here there was a choke\nthat couldn't be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while he\ncleared his \"confounded throat.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are; you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm so grateful\nto you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't see why I can't love you\nas you want me to. I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, and it\nwould be a lie to say I do when I don't.\"\n\n\"Really, truly, Jo?\"\n\nHe stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with\na\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a young man who has graduated with honor and is in love with Jo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILLIPS<|>PERSON<|>Phillips is mentioned as a comparison to Laurie's grace)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEMOSTHENES<|>PERSON<|>Demosthenes is mentioned as a comparison to Laurie's eloquence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Mr. and Mrs. March are mentioned as Laurie's family members)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a girl who is the object of Laurie's affection)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>JO<|>Laurie confesses his love for Jo and asks for a response<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
