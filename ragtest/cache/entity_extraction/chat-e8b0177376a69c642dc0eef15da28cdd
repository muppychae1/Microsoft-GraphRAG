You\ndon't look as if you were having a good time; are you?\" and Laurie\nlooked at her with an expression which made her answer, in a whisper,--\n\n\"No; not just now. Don't think I'm horrid; I only wanted a little fun,\nbut this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it.\"\n\n\"Here comes Ned Moffat; what does he want?\" said Laurie, knitting his\nblack brows, as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a\npleasant addition to the party.\n\n\"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's coming for\nthem. What a bore!\" said Meg, assuming a languid air, which amused\nLaurie immensely.\n\nHe did not speak to her again till supper-time, when he saw her drinking\nchampagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving \"like a pair\nof fools,\" as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of\nright to watch over the Marches, and fight their battles whenever a\ndefender was needed.\n\n                    [Illustration: I wouldn't, Meg]\n\n\"You'll have a splitting headache to-morrow, if you drink much of that.\nI wouldn't Meg; your mother doesn't like it, you know,\" he whispered,\nleaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass, and Fisher\nstooped to pick up her fan.\n\n\"I'm not Meg, to-night; I'm 'a doll,' who does all sorts of crazy\nthings. To-morrow I shall put away my 'fuss and feathers,' and be\ndesperately good again,\" she answered, with an affected little laugh.\n\n\"Wish to-morrow was here, then,\" muttered Laurie, walking off,\nill-pleased at the change he saw in her.\n\nMeg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did;\nafter supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly\nupsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that\nscandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he got no\nchance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say\ngood-night.\n\n\"Remember!\" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had\nalready begun.\n\n\"Silence à la mort,\" replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as he\nwent away.\n\nThis little bit of by-play excited Annie's curiosity; but Meg was too\ntired for gossip, and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a\nmasquerade, and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected. She was\nsick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with her\nfortnight's fun, and feeling that she had \"sat in the lap of luxury\"\nlong enough.\n\n\"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all\nthe time. Home _is_ a nice place, though it isn't splendid,\" said Meg,\nlooking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother\nand Jo on the Sunday evening.\n\n\"I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem\ndull and poor to you, after your fine quarters,\" replied her mother, who\nhad given her many anxious looks that day; for motherly eyes are quick\nto see any change in children's faces.\n\nMeg had told her adventures gayly, and said over and over what a\ncharming time she had had; but something still seemed to weigh upon her\nspirits, and, when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat\nthoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little, and looking worried. As\nthe clock struck nine, and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her chair,\nand, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee, saying\nbravely,--\n\n\"Marmee, I want to ''fess.'\"\n\n\"I thought so; what is it, dear?\"\n\n\"Shall I go away?\" asked Jo discreetly.\n\n\"Of course not; don't I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to\nspeak of it before the children, but I want you to know all the dreadful\nthings I did at the Moffat's.\"\n\n\"We are prepared,\" said Mrs. March, smiling, but looking a little\nanxious.\n\n\"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they powdered\nand squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a fashion-plate. Laurie\nthought I wasn't proper; I know he did, though he didn't say so, and one\nman called me 'a doll.' I knew it was silly, but they flattered me, and\nsaid I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a\nfool of me.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast\nface of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to blame\nher little follies.\n\n\"No; I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was altogether\nabominable,\" said Meg self-reproachfully.\n\n\"There is something more, I think;\" and Mrs. March smoothed the soft\ncheek, which suddenly grew rosy, as Meg answered slowly,--\n\n\"Yes; it's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have\npeople say and think such things about us and Laurie.\"\n\nThen she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats;\nand, as she spoke\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
