Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own, and\nfinished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy\ndaisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of a\ndemijohn. Then, distorting his pockets with the knobby bundles, and\ngiving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they\ntravelled on again.\n\n\"Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,\" began the Professor,\nafter a moist promenade of half a block.\n\n\"Yes, sir;\" and Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would\nhear it.\n\n\"I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time\nremains to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir;\" and Jo nearly crushed the small flower-pot with the sudden\nsqueeze she gave it.\n\n\"I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go\nalone. Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir;\" and Jo felt as calm and cool, all of a sudden, as if she had\nstepped into a refrigerator.\n\n\"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick, and\nthe husband is such a care. Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a\nfriendly thing to take the little mother.\"\n\n\"I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer. I'm going very fast and he's\ngetting dearer every minute,\" added Jo to herself; then, with a mental\nshake, she entered into the business with an energy which was pleasant\nto behold.\n\nMr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and\nthen ordered out the shawls. The clerk, being a married man,\ncondescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be\nshopping for their family.\n\n\"Your lady may prefer this; it's a superior article, a most desirable\ncolor, quite chaste and genteel,\" he said, shaking out a comfortable\ngray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.\n\n             [Illustration: Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?]\n\n\"Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?\" she asked, turning her back to him,\nand feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.\n\n\"Excellently well; we will haf it,\" answered the Professor, smiling to\nhimself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters\nlike a confirmed bargain-hunter.\n\n\"Now shall we go home?\" he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to\nhim.\n\n\"Yes; it's late, and I'm _so_ tired.\" Jo's voice was more pathetic than\nshe knew; for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came\nout, the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the first time\nshe discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and that her\nheart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the latter. Mr.\nBhaer was going away; he only cared for her as a friend; it was all a\nmistake, and the sooner it was over the better. With this idea in her\nhead, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that\nthe daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.\n\n\"This is not our omniboos,\" said the Professor, waving the loaded\nvehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, I didn't see the name distinctly. Never mind, I can\nwalk. I'm used to plodding in the mud,\" returned Jo, winking hard,\nbecause she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.\n\nMr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away;\nthe sight seemed to touch him very much, for, suddenly stooping down, he\nasked in a tone that meant a great deal,--\n\n\"Heart's dearest, why do you cry?\"\n\nNow, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said\nshe wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine\nfib proper to the occasion; instead of which that undignified creature\nanswered, with an irrepressible sob,--\n\n\"Because you are going away.\"\n\n\"Ach, mein Gott, that is _so_ good!\" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
