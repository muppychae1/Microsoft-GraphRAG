Amy knew her good points, and made the most of\nthem, with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty\nwoman.\n\nTarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them\non such occasions, and, following the sensible English fashion of simple\ndress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh\nflowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were\nboth inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed that the artist\nsometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique\n_coiffures_, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear\nheart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon\nsuch in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep\nour hearts merry with their artless vanities.\n\n\"I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,\" said Amy\nto herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball-dress, and covered\nit with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white shoulders and\ngolden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair she had the\nsense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a\nHebe-like knot at the back of her head.\n\n\"It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to make a\nfright of myself,\" she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or\nbraid, as the latest style commanded.\n\nHaving no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped\nher fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white\nshoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the painted boots, she\nsurveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and\n_chasséed_ down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.\n\n\"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the\nreal lace on aunt's _mouchoir_ gives an air to my whole dress. If I only\nhad a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,\" she said,\nsurveying herself with a critical eye, and a candle in each hand.\n\nIn spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as\nshe glided away; she seldom ran,--it did not suit her style, she\nthought, for, being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate\nthan the sportive or piquante. She walked up and down the long saloon\nwhile waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the\nchandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair; then she thought\nbetter of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed\nof the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. It so\nhappened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came in\nso quietly she did not hear him; and, as she stood at the distant\nwindow, with her head half turned, and one hand gathering up her dress,\nthe slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a\nwell-placed statue.\n\n\"Good evening, Diana!\" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she\nliked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.\n\n\"Good evening, Apollo!\" she answered, smiling back at him, for he, too,\nlooked unusually _debonnaire_, and the thought of entering the ball-room\non the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain\nMisses Davis from the bottom of her heart.\n\n\"Here are your flowers; I arranged them myself, remembering that you\ndidn't like what Hannah calls a 'sot-bookay,'\" said Laurie, handing her\na delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily\npassed it in Cardiglia's window.\n\n                  [Illustration: Here are your flowers]\n\n\"How kind you are!\" she exclaimed gratefully. \"If I'd known you were\ncoming I'd have had something ready for you to-day, though not as pretty\nas this, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Thank you; it isn't what it should be, but you have improved it,\" he\nadded, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.\n\n\"Please don't.\"\n\n\"I thought you liked that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"Not from you; it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old bluntness\nbetter.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it,\" he answered, with a look of relief; then buttoned her\ngloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to do\nwhen they went to parties together, at home.\n\nThe company assembled in the long _salle à manger_, that evening, was\nsuch as one sees nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable Americans\nhad invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and, having no\nprejudice against titles, secured a few to add lustre to their Christmas\nball.\n\nA Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour, and talk\nwith a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother, in black velvet, with\na pearl bridle under her chin. A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted\nhimself to the ladies, who pronounced him \"a fascinating dear,\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
