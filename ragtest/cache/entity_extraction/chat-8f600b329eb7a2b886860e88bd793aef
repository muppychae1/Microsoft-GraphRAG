Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is not\nfor us to dictate when she offers such a favor.\"\n\n\"It's always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn't\nfair, oh, it isn't fair!\" cried Jo passionately.\n\n\"I'm afraid it is partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to me the\nother day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit;\nand here she writes, as if quoting something you had said,--'I planned\nat first to ask Jo; but as \"favors burden her,\" and she \"hates French,\"\nI think I won't venture to invite her. Amy is more docile, will make a\ngood companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the trip may\ngive her.'\"\n\n\"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! why can't I learn to keep it\nquiet?\" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing. When\nshe had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said\nsorrowfully,--\n\n\"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time; so\ntry to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure by reproaches\nor regrets.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said Jo, winking hard, as she knelt down to pick up the\nbasket she had joyfully upset. \"I'll take a leaf out of her book, and\ntry not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute\nof happiness; but it won't be easy, for it is a dreadful\ndisappointment;\" and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held\nwith several very bitter tears.\n\n\"Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm glad you\nare not going quite yet,\" whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and all,\nwith such a clinging touch and loving face, that Jo felt comforted in\nspite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears, and\nhumbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how\ngratefully she would bear it.\n\nBy the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family\njubilation; not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without\nrepinings at Amy's good fortune. The young lady herself received the\nnews as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,\nand began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving\nsuch trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in\nvisions of art than herself.\n\n\"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,\" she said impressively, as\nshe scraped her best palette. \"It will decide my career; for if I have\nany genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove\nit.\"\n\n\"Suppose you haven't?\" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new\ncollars which were to be handed over to Amy.\n\n\"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,\" replied the\naspirant for fame, with philosophic composure; but she made a wry face\nat the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on\nvigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.\n\n\"No, you won't; you hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man, and\ncome home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,\" said Jo.\n\n\"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one\nwill. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I\nshould like to be able to help those who are,\" said Amy, smiling, as if\nthe part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor\ndrawing-teacher.\n\n\"Hum!\" said Jo, with a sigh; \"if you wish it you'll have it, for your\nwishes are always granted--mine never.\"\n\n\"Would you like to go?\" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with\nher knife.\n\n\"Rather!\"\n\n\"Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum\nfor relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many times.\"\n\n\"Thank you; I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes,\nif it ever does,\" returned Jo, accepting the vague but magnificent offer\nas gratefully as she could.\n\nThere was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment\ntill Amy was off. Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue\nribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried\ntill she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the\nsteamer sailed; then, just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it\nsuddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her\nand those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last\nlingerer, saying with a sob,--\n\n\"Oh, take care of them for me; and if anything should happen--\"\n\n\"I will, dear, I will; and if anything happens, I'll come and comfort\nyou,\" whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to\nkeep his word.\n\nSo Amy sailed away to find the old world, which is always new and\nbeautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from\nthe shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
