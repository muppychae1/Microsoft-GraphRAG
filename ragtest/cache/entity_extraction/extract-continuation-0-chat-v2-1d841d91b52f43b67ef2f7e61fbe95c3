The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten\nin the sting of the thought,--\n\n\"I shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!\"\n\nThe fifteen minutes seemed an hour; but they came to an end at last, and\nthe word \"Recess!\" had never seemed so welcome to her before.\n\n\"You can go, Miss March,\" said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,\nuncomfortable.\n\nHe did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went,\nwithout a word to any one, straight into the ante-room, snatched her\nthings, and left the place \"forever,\" as she passionately declared to\nherself. She was in a sad state when she got home; and when the older\ngirls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held at\nonce. Mrs. March did not say much, but looked disturbed, and comforted\nher afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the\ninsulted hand with glycerine and tears; Beth felt that even her beloved\nkittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this; Jo wrathfully\nproposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay; and Hannah shook her\nfist at the \"villain,\" and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him\nunder her pestle.\n\nNo notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates; but the\nsharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in\nthe afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo\nappeared, wearing a grim expression, as she stalked up to the desk, and\ndelivered a letter from her mother; then collected Amy's property, and\ndeparted, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door-mat, as\nif she shook the dust of the place off her feet.\n\n\"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a\nlittle every day, with Beth,\" said Mrs. March, that evening. \"I don't\napprove of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr.\nDavis's manner of teaching, and don't think the girls you associate with\nare doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I\nsend you anywhere else.\"\n\n\"That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old\nschool. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,\" sighed\nAmy, with the air of a martyr.\n\n\"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved\nsome punishment for disobedience,\" was the severe reply, which rather\ndisappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.\n\n\"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\"\ncried Amy.\n\n\"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\" replied her\nmother; \"but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a milder\nmethod. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite\ntime you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and\nvirtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the\nfinest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness\nwill be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing\nand using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power\nis modesty.\"\n\n\"So it is!\" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo. \"I\nknew a girl, once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she\ndidn't know it; never guessed what sweet little things she composed when\nshe was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if any one had told her.\"\n\n\"I wish I'd known that nice girl; maybe she would have helped me, I'm so\nstupid,\" said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.\n\n\"You do know her, and she helps you better than any one else could,\"\nanswered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his\nmerry black eyes, that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face\nin the sofa-cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.\n\n                    [Illustration: You do know her]\n\nJo let Laurie win the game, to pay for that praise of her Beth, who\ncould not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So\nLaurie did his best, and sung delightfully, being in a particularly\nlively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his\ncharacter. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all the evening,\nsaid suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,--\n\n\"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?\"\n\n\"Yes; he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will\nmake a fine man, if not spoilt by petting,\" replied her mother.\n\n\"And he isn't conceited, is he?\" asked Amy.\n\n\"Not in the least; that is why he is so charming, and we all like him so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"I see; it's nice to have accomplishments, and be elegant; but not to\nshow off, or get perked up,\" said Amy thoughtfully.\n\n\"These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and\nconversation, if modestly used; but it is not necessary to display\nthem,\" said Mrs. March.\n\n\"Any more than it's proper to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARCHES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Marches are a family with multiple daughters attending school)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is one of the daughters in the Marches family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
