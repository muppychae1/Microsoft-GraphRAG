We used the semi-colon. \n\nOn page 34, transcribe red-headed with the hyphen. See page 44 of the\n1869 novel.\n\nOn page 40, a period was added after \"room where old Mr\". See page 50 of\nthe 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 41, the semicolon after \"Laurie went on the box\" was replaced\nwith a comma. See page 52 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 62, mantel-piece was transcribed with the hyphen. See Page 75 of\nthe 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 63, checked the clause \"and I've been trying to do it this ever\nso long.\" It is written the same way on page 77 of the 1869 book. No\nchange was made.\n\nOn page 64, add period after \"red and shining with merriment.\" See page\n79 of the 1869 book.\n\nOn page 68, changed weet to sweet in 'the damp weet air.' See page 84 of\nthe 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 79, add comma after I remain in the letter. See page 95 of the\n1869 novel.\n\nOn page 84, ferrule was an adjustment from the 1869 book, which only\nused one r in spelling the word (see page 101). Webster's dictionary\nspells ferrule with two rs.\n\nOn page 109, a period was added after \"and the old man quite dotes on\nthem\". See page 130 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 109, a period was added after \"asked another voice\". See page\n131 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 112, change colon to semicolon after \"if you don't;\"--see page\n134 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 113, transcribe ear-rings with the hyphen. See page 135 of the\n1869 novel.\n\nOn Page 123, \"One thing remember, my girls:\" is written as it appears in\nthe 1896 novel. A comma instead of a colon was used after my girls in\nthe 1869 novel (see page 146). \"One thing =to= remember,\" may work\nbetter today, or even \"Remember one thing,\" but we left this as Ms.\nAlcott wrote it.\n\nOn Page 124, the P. C. is the Pickwick Club from a novel by Charles\nDickens. Samuel Pickwick, Tracy Tupman, Augustus Snodgrass, and\nNathaniel Winkle were introdued by Charles Dickens in the first chapter\nof The Pickwick Papers. Samuel Weller makes his first appearance in\nChapter Ten of that novel.\n\nOn page 128, in the Pickwick Portfolio, there is no period after \"it is\nnearly school time\" in N. Winkle's letter. This period was also missing\non page 151 of the 1869 novel. The missing period was intentional.\n\nOn page 135, the ambiguous punctuation after \"Oh, dear, no!\" is an\nexclamation point. See page 160 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 146, change buttonholes to button-holes. On page 173 of the 1869\nnovel, this word was hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing.\nThere were seven other occurrences of button-hole or button-holes in the\nnovel.  We therefore used the hyphen.\n\nOn page 150, \"Betty\" was replaced with \"Bethy\". This error was also made\nin the 1869 novel--see page 177. The character addressed is Beth. \n\nOn page 158, a period was added after \"still kneeling\". See page 187 of\nthe 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 160, \"hard a lee\" is spelled the same way in the 1869 novel (see\npage 189) and this novel. We left this as is.\n\nOn page 166, a comma was added after \"Meg\" in \"Meg obediently\nfollowing\". See page 195 of the 1869 book.\n\nOn page 185, \"receptable\" was replaced with \"receptacle\". See page 217\nof the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 185, transcribe door-way with the hyphen. See page 217 of the\n1869 novel. Also, change doorway to door-way a few lines down the same\npage. See page 218 of the 1869 novel.\n\nOn page 189, the comma after \"published every day\" was replaced with a\nperiod. See page 225 of 1869 book.\n\nOn page 198, the clause: \"Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of\nbottles of old wine:\" was written as it appeared in the 1896 novel. The\nclause ended in with a semi-colon in the 1869 book (see page 234). \n\nOn page 200, change needlework to needle-work. See page 236 of the 1869\nnovel.\n\nOn page 209, \"turnovers\" was replaced with \"turn-overs\".\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PICKWICK CLUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Pickwick Club is a fictional organization from a novel by Charles Dickens)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL PICKWICK<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Pickwick is a character introduced by Charles Dickens in The Pickwick Papers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRACY TUPMAN<|>PERSON<|>Tracy Tupman is a character introduced by Charles Dickens in The Pickwick Papers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUGUSTUS SNODGRASS<|>PERSON<|>Augustus Snodgrass is a character introduced by Charles Dickens in The Pickwick Papers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATHANIEL WINKLE<|>PERSON<|>Nathaniel Winkle is a character introduced by Charles Dickens in The Pickwick Papers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL WELLER<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Weller is a character introduced by Charles Dickens in The Pickwick Papers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES DICKENS<|>PERSON<|>Charles Dickens is the author of The Pickwick Papers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is a character addressed in the novel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS.
