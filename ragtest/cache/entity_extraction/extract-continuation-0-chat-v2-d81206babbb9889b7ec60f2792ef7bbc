I don't believe\nyou've got any heart.\"\n\n\"I wish I hadn't!\"\n\nThere was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and, thinking it a good omen,\nLaurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he\nsaid, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously\nwheedlesome before,--\n\n\"Don't disappoint us, dear! Every one expects it. Grandpa has set his\nheart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get on without you. Say\nyou will, and let's be happy. Do, do!\"\n\nNot until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of\nmind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that\nshe did not love her boy, and never could. It was very hard to do, but\nshe did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.\n\n\"I can't say 'Yes' truly, so I won't say it at all. You'll see that I'm\nright, by and by, and thank me for it\"--she began solemnly.\n\n\"I'll be hanged if I do!\" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning\nwith indignation at the bare idea.\n\n\"Yes, you will!\" persisted Jo; \"you'll get over this after a while, and\nfind some lovely, accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a fine\nmistress for your fine house. I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward and\nodd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel,--we\ncan't help it even now, you see,--and I shouldn't like elegant society\nand you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on\nwithout it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and\neverything would be horrid!\"\n\n\"Anything more?\" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to\nthis prophetic burst.\n\n\"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry. I'm happy\nas I am, and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up\nfor any mortal man.\"\n\n\"I know better!\" broke in Laurie. \"You think so now; but there'll come a\ntime when you _will_ care for somebody, and you'll love him\ntremendously, and live and die for him. I know you will, it's your way,\nand I shall have to stand by and see it;\" and the despairing lover cast\nhis hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical,\nif his face had not been so tragical.\n\n\"Yes, I _will_ live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love\nhim in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!\" cried Jo,\nlosing patience with poor Teddy. \"I've done my best, but you _won't_ be\nreasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't\ngive. I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but\nI'll never marry you; and the sooner you believe it, the better for both\nof us,--so now!\"\n\nThat speech was like fire to gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as\nif he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply\naway, saying, in a desperate sort of tone,--\n\n\"You'll be sorry some day, Jo.\"\n\n\"Oh, where are you going?\" she cried, for his face frightened her.\n\n\"To the devil!\" was the consoling answer.\n\nFor a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank,\ntoward the river; but it takes much folly, sin, or misery to send a\nyoung man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort\nwho are conquered by a single failure. He had no thought of a\nmelodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and\ncoat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time\nup the river than he had done in many a race. Jo drew a long breath and\nunclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip\nthe trouble which he carried in his heart.\n\n\"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent\nstate of mind, that I sha'n't dare to see him,\" she said; adding, as she\nwent slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,\nand buried it under the leaves,--\n\n\"Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.\nI wish he'd love Beth; perhaps he may, in time, but I begin to think I\nwas mistaken about her. Oh dear! how can girls like to have lovers and\nrefuse them. I think it's dreadful.\"\n\nBeing sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight\nto Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then broke\ndown, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old\ngentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach. He\nfound it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie,\nand hoped\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character in the text who is in love with Jo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character in the text who is struggling with her feelings towards Laurie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
