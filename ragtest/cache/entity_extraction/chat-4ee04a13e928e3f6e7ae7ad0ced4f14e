Being\nstill too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to\nafford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\nwits to work, and--necessity being the mother of invention,--made\nwhatever they needed. Very clever were some of their\nproductions,--pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned\nbutter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton,\nglittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered\nwith the same useful diamond-shaped bits, left in sheets when the lids\nof tin preserve-pots were cut out. The furniture was used to being\nturned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent\nrevels.\n\nNo gentlemen were admitted; so Jo played male parts to her heart's\ncontent, and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots\ngiven her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots,\nan old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\npicture, were Jo's chief treasures, and appeared on all occasions. The\nsmallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\nto take several parts apiece; and they certainly deserved some credit\nfor the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\nwhisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.\nIt was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and\nemployed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or\nspent in less profitable society.\n\nOn Christmas night, a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the\ndress-circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\nmost flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling\nand whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp-smoke, and an\noccasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\nexcitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\napart, and the Operatic Tragedy began.\n\n\"A gloomy wood,\" according to the one play-bill, was represented by a\nfew shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the\ndistance. This cave was made with a clothes-horse for a roof, bureaus\nfor walls; and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot\non it, and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark, and the\nglow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\nfrom the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed\nfor the first thrill to subside; then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with\na clanking sword at his side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious\ncloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he\nstruck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his\nhatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to\nkill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an\noccasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive,\nand the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with\nthe air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern, and\nordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding \"What ho, minion! I need\nthee!\"\n\n[Illustration: Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face]\n\nOut came Meg, with gray horse-hair hanging about her face, a red and\nblack robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded\na potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in\na fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the\nspirit who would bring the love philter:--\n\n        \"Hither, hither, from thy home,\n         Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\n         Born of roses, fed on dew,\n         Charms and potions canst thou brew?\n         Bring me here, with elfin speed,\n         The fragrant philter which I need;\n         Make it sweet and swift and strong,\n         Spirit, answer now my song!\"\n\n            [Illustration: A little figure in cloudy white]\n\nA soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\nappeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden\nhair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang,--\n\n         \"Hither I come,\n          From my airy home,\n        Afar in the silver moon.\n          Take the magic spell,\n          And use it well,\n        Or its power will vanish soon!\"\n\nAnd, dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit\nvanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,--not a\nlovely one; for, with a bang, an ugly black imp appeared, and, having\ncroaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo, and disappeared with a\nmocking laugh.
