I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch\nin a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the\nsky, and the weathercock; I wish he would go, too. There's Laurie,\nlooking like a sailor,--nice boy! Oh, mercy me! here's a carriage full\nof people--a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. One is\nlame; poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell us that. Be\nquick, girls! it's getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare.\nLook, Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day, when we were\nshopping?\"\n\n\"So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at the\nMountains. There is Sallie; I'm glad she got back in time. Am I all\nright, Jo?\" cried Meg, in a flutter.\n\n\"A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat straight; it looks\nsentimental tipped that way, and will fly off at the first puff. Now,\nthen, come on!\"\n\n\"O Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It's too absurd! You\nshall _not_ make a guy of yourself,\" remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down,\nwith a red ribbon, the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned Leghorn Laurie had\nsent for a joke.\n\n\"I just will, though, for it's capital,--so shady, light, and big. It\nwill make fun; and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable.\" With\nthat Jo marched straight away, and the rest followed,--a bright little\nband of sisters, all looking their best, in summer suits, with happy\nfaces under the jaunty hat-brims.\n\nLaurie ran to meet, and present them to his friends, in the most cordial\nmanner. The lawn was the reception-room, and for several minutes a\nlively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate,\nthough twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would\ndo well to imitate; and she was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances\nthat he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie \"primmed up\nhis mouth\" when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a\nstand-off-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free\nand easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the\nnew boys, and decided that the lame one was not \"dreadful,\" but gentle\nand feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found\nGrace a well-mannered, merry little person; and after staring dumbly at\none another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends.\n\nTents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the\nparty was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving\nMr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo rowed one boat;\nMr. Brooke and Ned the other; while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did\nhis best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed\nwater-bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of\ngeneral utility; it broke the ice in the beginning, by producing a\nlaugh; it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro, as she\nrowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a\nshower came up, she said. Kate looked rather amazed at Jo's proceedings,\nespecially as she exclaimed \"Christopher Columbus!\" when she lost her\noar; and Laurie said, \"My dear fellow, did I hurt you?\" when he tripped\nover her feet in taking his place. But after putting up her glass to\nexamine the queer girl several times, Miss Kate decided that she was\n\"odd, but rather clever,\" and smiled upon her from afar.\n\n              [Illustration: Mr. Laurence waving his hat]\n\nMeg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the\nrowers, who both admired the prospect, and feathered their oars with\nuncommon \"skill and dexterity.\" Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young\nman, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet\nmanners, and considered him a walking encyclopædia of useful knowledge.\nHe never talked to her much; but he looked at her a good deal, and she\nfelt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in\ncollege, of course put on all the airs which Freshmen think it their\nbounden duty to assume; he was not very wise, but very good-natured, and\naltogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was\nabsorbed in keeping her white piqué dress clean, and chattering with the\nubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.\n\nIt was not far to Longmeadow; but the tent was pitched and the wickets\ndown by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with three\nwide-spreading oaks in the middle, and a smooth strip of turf for\ncroquet.\n\n\"Welcome to Camp Laurence!\" said the young host, as they landed, with\nexclamations of delight.\n\n\"Brooke is commander-in-chief; I am commissary-general; the other\nfellows are staff-officers; and you, ladies\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
