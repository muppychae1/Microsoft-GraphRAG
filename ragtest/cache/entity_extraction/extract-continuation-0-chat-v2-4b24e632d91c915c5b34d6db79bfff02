They kissed their\nmother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands\ncheerfully when she drove away.\n\nLaurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke\nlooked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him\n\"Mr. Greatheart\" on the spot.\n\n\"Good-by, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!\" whispered Mrs. March,\nas she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried into the\ncarriage.\n\nAs she rolled away, the sun came out, and, looking back, she saw it\nshining on the group at the gate, like a good omen. They saw it also,\nand smiled and waved their hands; and the last thing she beheld, as she\nturned the corner, was the four bright faces, and behind them, like a\nbody-guard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.\n\n                    [Illustration: She rolled away]\n\n\"How kind every one is to us!\" she said, turning to find fresh proof of\nit in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.\n\n\"I don't see how they can help it,\" returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so\ninfectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling; and so the long\njourney began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful\nwords.\n\n\"I feel as if there had been an earthquake,\" said Jo, as their neighbors\nwent home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.\n\n\"It seems as if half the house was gone,\" added Meg forlornly.\n\nBeth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile\nof nicely-mended hose which lay on mother's table, showing that even in\nher last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. It was a\nlittle thing, but it went straight to their hearts; and, in spite of\ntheir brave resolutions, they all broke down, and cried bitterly.\n\nHannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and, when the\nshower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with a\ncoffee-pot.\n\n\"Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don't fret.\nCome and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's fall to work,\nand be a credit to the family.\"\n\nCoffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that\nmorning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant\ninvitation issuing from the nose of the coffee-pot. They drew up to the\ntable, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes\nwere all right again.\n\n\"'Hope and keep busy;' that's the motto for us, so let's see who will\nremember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won't she\nlecture though!\" said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.\n\n\"I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home and attend\nto things here,\" said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her eyes so red.\n\n\"No need of that; Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,\" put in Amy,\nwith an important air.\n\n\"Hannah will tell us what to do; and we'll have everything nice when you\ncome home,\" added Beth, getting out her mop and dish-tub without delay.\n\n\"I think anxiety is very interesting,\" observed Amy, eating sugar,\npensively.\n\nThe girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg\nshook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a\nsugar-bowl.\n\nThe sight of the turn-overs made Jo sober again; and when the two went\nout to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window\nwhere they were accustomed to see their mother's face. It was gone; but\nBeth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she was,\nnodding away at them like a rosy-faced mandarin.\n\n\"That's so like my Beth!\" said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful face.\n\"Good-by, Meggy; I hope the Kings won't train to-day. Don't fret about\nfather, dear,\" she added, as they parted.\n\n\"And I hope Aunt March won't croak. Your hair _is_ becoming, and it\nlooks very boyish and nice,\" returned Meg, trying not to smile at the\ncurly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister's shoulders.\n\n\"That's my only comfort;\" and, touching her hat _à la_ Laurie, away went\nJo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.\n\nNews from their father comforted the girls very much; for, though\ndangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had\nalready done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and, as the\nhead of the family, Meg insisted on reading the despatches, which grew\nmore and more cheering as the week passed. At first, every one was eager\nto write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter-box\nby one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their\nWashington correspondence. As one of these packets contained\ncharacteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and\nread them:--\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character who came to see off Mrs. March)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
