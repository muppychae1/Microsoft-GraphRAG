Beth\nbeamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the\nyoung couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident\nAunt March was right in calling them as \"unworldly as a pair of babies.\"\nNo one ate much, but every one looked very happy, and the old room\nseemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family\nbegan there.\n\n\"You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?\" said\nAmy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in the sketch she\nwas planning to take.\n\n\"No, I'm sure I can't. How much has happened since I said that! It seems\na year ago,\" answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream, lifted far above\nsuch common things as bread and butter.\n\n\"The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the\nchanges have begun,\" said Mrs. March. \"In most families there comes, now\nand then, a year full of events; this has been such an one, but it ends\nwell, after all.\"\n\n\"Hope the next will end better,\" muttered Jo, who found it very hard to\nsee Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face; for Jo loved a few\npersons very dearly, and dreaded to have their affection lost or\nlessened in any way.\n\n\"I hope the third year from this _will_ end better; I mean it shall, if\nI live to work out my plans,\" said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if\neverything had become possible to him now.\n\n\"Doesn't it seem very long to wait?\" asked Amy, who was in a hurry for\nthe wedding.\n\n\"I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short\ntime to me,\" answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face, never seen\nthere before.\n\n\"You have only to wait; _I_ am to do the work,\" said John, beginning his\nlabors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo to\nshake her head, and then say to herself, with an air of relief, as the\nfront door banged, \"Here comes Laurie. Now we shall have a little\nsensible conversation.\"\n\nBut Jo was mistaken; for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with\nspirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for \"Mrs. John Brooke,\"\nand evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been\nbrought about by his excellent management.\n\n                  [Illustration: For Mrs. John Brooke]\n\n\"I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does; for when\nhe makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done, though the sky\nfalls,\" said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his\ncongratulations.\n\n\"Much obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen for the\nfuture, and invite you to my wedding on the spot,\" answered Mr. Brooke,\nwho felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.\n\n\"I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth; for the sight of Jo's face\nalone, on that occasion, would be worth a long journey. You don't look\nfestive, ma'am; what's the matter?\" asked Laurie, following her into a\ncorner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.\n\n\"I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and\nshall not say a word against it,\" said Jo solemnly. \"You can't know how\nhard it is for me to give up Meg,\" she continued, with a little quiver\nin her voice.\n\n\"You don't give her up. You only go halves,\" said Laurie consolingly.\n\n\"It never can be the same again. I've lost my dearest friend,\" sighed\nJo.\n\n\"You've got me, anyhow. I'm not good for much, I know; but I'll stand\nby you, Jo, all the days of my life; upon my word I will!\" and Laurie\nmeant what he said.\n\n\"I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged; you are always a great\ncomfort to me, Teddy,\" returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.\n\n\"Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow. It's all right, you\nsee. Meg is happy; Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately;\ngrandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her\nown little house. We'll have capital times after she is gone, for I\nshall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad, or some\nnice trip or other. Wouldn't that console you?\"\n\n\"I rather think it would; but there's no knowing what may happen in\nthree years,\" said Jo thoughtfully.\n\n\"That's true. Don't you wish you could take a look forward, and see\nwhere we shall all be then? I do,\" returned Laurie.\n\n\"I think not, for I might see something sad; and every one looks so\nhappy now, I don't believe they could be much improved,\" and Jo's eyes\nwent slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the prospect\nwas a pleasant one.\n\nFather and mother sat together, quietly re-living the first chapter of\nthe romance which for them began some twenty years ago.
