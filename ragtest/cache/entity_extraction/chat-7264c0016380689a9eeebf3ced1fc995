There was nothing he didn't offer, from his own\ndressing-gown to himself as escort. But that last was impossible. Mrs.\nMarch would not hear of the old gentleman's undertaking the long\njourney; yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it,\nfor anxiety ill fits one for travelling. He saw the look, knit his heavy\neyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he'd be\nback directly. No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran\nthrough the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea\nin the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.\n\n           [Illustration: She came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke]\n\n\"I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,\" he said, in the kind,\nquiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit. \"I\ncame to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr. Laurence has\ncommissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction\nto be of service to her there.\"\n\nDown dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg\nput out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude, that Mr. Brooke\nwould have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling\none of time and comfort which he was about to make.\n\n\"How kind you all are! Mother will accept, I'm sure; and it will be such\na relief to know that she has some one to take care of her. Thank you\nvery, very much!\"\n\nMeg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the\nbrown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and\nlead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.\n\nEverything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from\nAunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what\nshe had often said before,--that she had always told them it was absurd\nfor March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come\nof it, and she hoped they would take her advice next time. Mrs. March\nput the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on with her\npreparations, with her lips folded tightly, in a way which Jo would have\nunderstood if she had been there.\n\nThe short afternoon wore away; all the other errands were done, and Meg\nand her mother busy at some necessary needle-work, while Beth and Amy\ngot tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a \"slap\nand a bang,\" but still Jo did not come. They began to get anxious; and\nLaurie went off to find her, for no one ever knew what freak Jo might\ntake into her head. He missed her, however, and she came walking in with\na very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun\nand fear, satisfaction and regret, in it, which puzzled the family as\nmuch as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying, with a\nlittle choke in her voice, \"That's my contribution towards making\nfather comfortable and bringing him home!\"\n\n\"My dear, where did you get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I hope you\nhaven't done anything rash?\n\n\"No, it's mine honestly; I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it. I earned it;\nand I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for\nall her abundant hair was cut short.\n\n\"Your hair! Your beautiful hair!\" \"O Jo, how could you? Your one\nbeauty.\" \"My dear girl, there was no need of this.\" \"She doesn't look\nlike my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!\"\n\nAs every one exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo\nassumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive any one a particle,\nand said, rumpling up the brown bush, and trying to look as if she liked\nit, \"It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth. It\nwill be good for my vanity; I was getting too proud of my wig. It will\ndo my brains good to have that mop taken off; my head feels deliciously\nlight and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop,\nwhich will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order. I'm\nsatisfied; so please take the money, and let's have supper.\"\n\n\"Tell me all about it, Jo. _I_ am not quite satisfied, but I can't blame\nyou, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call\nit, to your love. But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I'm afraid you\nwill regret it, one of these days,\" said Mrs. March.\n\n\"No, I won't!\" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her prank\nwas not entirely condemned.\n\n\"What made you do it?\" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of\ncutting off her head as her pretty hair.\n\n\"Well, I was wild to do something for father,\" replied Jo, as they\ngathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the\nmidst of trouble\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
