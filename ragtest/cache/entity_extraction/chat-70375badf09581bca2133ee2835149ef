Please remember that\nthere is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.\"\n\nThen the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly\nilluminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most\ndelightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\n\n\"I too shall go; but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me\nleave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here\nsome days.\"\n\nHe spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo; and the mother's voice gave\nas cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes; for Mrs. March was not\nso blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.\n\n\"I suspect that is a wise man,\" remarked Mr. March, with placid\nsatisfaction, from the hearth-rug, after the last guest had gone.\n\n\"I know he is a good one,\" added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as\nshe wound up the clock.\n\n\"I thought you'd like him,\" was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her\nbed.\n\nShe wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,\nand finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,\nsomewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen\nhis face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a\nsevere and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to\nbe gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the\nsubject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture\nin the dark.\n\n\n\n\n       [Illustration: Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap]\n\n                                 XLIV.\n\n                           MY LORD AND LADY.\n\n\n\"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour? The\nluggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris finery, trying\nto find some things I want,\" said Laurie, coming in the next day to find\nMrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap, as if being made \"the baby\"\nagain.\n\n\"Certainly. Go, dear; I forget that you have any home but this,\" and\nMrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding-ring, as if\nasking pardon for her maternal covetousness.\n\n\"I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it; but I can't get\non without my little woman any more than a--\"\n\n\"Weathercock can without wind,\" suggested Jo, as he paused for a simile;\nJo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came home.\n\n\"Exactly; for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with only\nan occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven't had an easterly\nspell since I was married; don't know anything about the north, but am\naltogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?\"\n\n\"Lovely weather so far; I don't know how long it will last, but I'm not\nafraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship. Come home, dear,\nand I'll find your bootjack; I suppose that's what you are rummaging\nafter among my things. Men are _so_ helpless, mother,\" said Amy, with a\nmatronly air, which delighted her husband.\n\n\"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?\" asked\nJo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.\n\n\"We have our plans; we don't mean to say much about them yet, because we\nare such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be idle. I'm going into\nbusiness with a devotion that shall delight grandfather, and prove to\nhim that I'm not spoilt. I need something of the sort to keep me steady.\nI'm tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.\"\n\n\"And Amy, what is she going to do?\" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at\nLaurie's decision, and the energy with which he spoke.\n\n\"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall\nastonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant\nsociety we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall\nexert over the world at large. That's about it, isn't it, Madame\nRécamier?\" asked Laurie, with a quizzical look at Amy.\n\n\"Time will show. Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock my family by\ncalling me names before their faces,\" answered Amy, resolving that there\nshould be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a _salon_ as a\nqueen of society.\n\n\"How happy those children seem together!\" observed Mr. March, finding it\ndifficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple had\ngone.\n\n\"Yes, and I think it will last,\" added Mrs. March, with the restful\nexpression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.\n\n\"I know it will. Happy Amy!\" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as\nProfessor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.\n\nLater in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the\nbootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, who was flitting about,\narranging her new art treasures,--\n\n\"Mrs. Laurence.\"\n\n\"My lord!\"\n\n\"That man intends to marry our Jo!\"\n\n\"I hope so; don't you, dear?\"\n\n\"Well,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
