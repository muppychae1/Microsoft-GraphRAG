My partners do almost\neverything; I'm merely holding on till you take my place, and can be off\nat any time.\"\n\n\"But you hate travelling, sir; I can't ask it of you at your age,\" began\nLaurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go\nalone, if he went at all.\n\nThe old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to\nprevent it; for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that\nit would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. So, stifling a\nnatural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind\nhim, he said stoutly,--\n\n\"Bless your soul, I'm not superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea; it\nwill do me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for travelling nowadays\nis almost as easy as sitting in a chair.\"\n\nA restless movement from Laurie suggested that _his_ chair was not easy,\nor that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily,--\n\n\"I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden; I go because I think you'd\nfeel happier than if I was left behind. I don't intend to gad about with\nyou, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in my\nown way. I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit\nthem; meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you\nwill, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your heart's\ncontent.\"\n\nNow, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken, and the\nworld a howling wilderness; but at the sound of certain words which the\nold gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken\nheart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly\nappeared in the howling wilderness. He sighed, and then said, in a\nspiritless tone,--\n\n\"Just as you like, sir; it doesn't matter where I go or what I do.\"\n\n\"It does to me, remember that, my lad; I give you entire liberty, but I\ntrust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me that, Laurie.\"\n\n\"Anything you like, sir.\"\n\n\"Good,\" thought the old gentleman. \"You don't care now, but there'll\ncome a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I'm much\nmistaken.\"\n\nBeing an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was\nhot; and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,\nthey were off. During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore\nhimself as young gentlemen usually do in such cases. He was moody,\nirritable, and pensive by turns; lost his appetite, neglected his dress,\nand devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano; avoided Jo,\nbut consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragical\nface that haunted her dreams by night, and oppressed her with a heavy\nsense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his\nunrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to\nattempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some accounts, this was a\nrelief to his friends; but the weeks before his departure were very\nuncomfortable, and every one rejoiced that the \"poor, dear fellow was\ngoing away to forget his trouble, and come home happy.\" Of course, he\nsmiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by, with the sad\nsuperiority of one who knew that his fidelity, like his love, was\nunalterable.\n\nWhen the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain\ninconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves. This\ngayety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did,\nfor his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with\na whisper full of motherly solicitude; then, feeling that he was going\nvery fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the\nafflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life. Jo followed a\nminute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. He did look\nround, came back, put his arms about her, as she stood on the step above\nhim, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal both\neloquent and pathetic.\n\n\"O Jo, can't you?\"\n\n                    [Illustration: O Jo, can't you?]\n\n\"Teddy, dear, I wish I could!\"\n\nThat was all, except a little pause; then Laurie straightened himself\nup, said \"It's all right, never mind,\" and went away without another\nword. Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo _did_ mind; for while the\ncurly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as if\nshe had stabbed her dearest friend; and when he left her without a look\nbehind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                                 XXXVI.\n\n                             BETH'S SECRET.\n\n\nWhen Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in\nBeth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too\ngradually to startle those who saw her daily; but to eyes sharpened by\nabsence, it was very plain; and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she\nsaw her sister's face.
