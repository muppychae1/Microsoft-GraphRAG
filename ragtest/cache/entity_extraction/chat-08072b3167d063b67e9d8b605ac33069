Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite of\nthe great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious thoughts\nshe had ever known in her short life. Jo lay motionless, and her sister\nfancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her exclaim, as she\ntouched a wet cheek,--\n\n\"Jo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about father?\"\n\n\"No, not now.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"My--my hair!\" burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her emotion\nin the pillow.\n\nIt did not sound at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the\nafflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.\n\n\"I'm not sorry,\" protested Jo, with a choke. \"I'd do it again to-morrow,\nif I could. It's only the vain, selfish part of me that goes and cries\nin this silly way. Don't tell any one, it's all over now. I thought you\nwere asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my one beauty. How\ncame you to be awake?\"\n\n\"I can't sleep, I'm so anxious,\" said Meg.\n\n\"Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off.\"\n\n\"I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.\"\n\n\"What did you think of?\"\n\n\"Handsome faces,--eyes particularly,\" answered Meg, smiling to herself,\nin the dark.\n\n\"What color do you like best?\"\n\n\"Brown--that is, sometimes; blue are lovely.\"\n\nJo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably\npromised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in\nher castle in the air.\n\nThe clocks were striking midnight, and the rooms were very still, as a\nfigure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlid here,\nsettling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each\nunconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to\npray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter. As she lifted the\ncurtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from\nbehind the clouds, and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face,\nwhich seemed to whisper in the silence, \"Be comforted, dear soul! There\nis always light behind the clouds.\"\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                        [Illustration: Letters]\n\n                                  XVI.\n\n                                LETTERS.\n\n\nIn the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp, and read their chapter\nwith an earnestness never felt before; for now the shadow of a real\ntrouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort; and,\nas they dressed, they agreed to say good-by cheerfully and hopefully,\nand send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or\ncomplaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went\ndown,--so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.\nBreakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar face\nlooked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her night-cap on.\nThe big trunk stood ready in the hall, mother's cloak and bonnet lay on\nthe sofa, and mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and\nworn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to\nkeep their resolution. Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of herself; Jo\nwas obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once; and\nthe little girls' wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a\nnew experience to them.\n\nNobody talked much, but as the time drew very near, and they sat waiting\nfor the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied\nabout her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of\nher bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up\nher travelling bag,--\n\n\"Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's protection.\nHannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as\nif you were his own. I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that you\nshould take this trouble rightly. Don't grieve and fret when I am gone,\nor think that you can comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to\nforget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace.\nHope and keep busy; and whatever happens, remember that you never can be\nfatherless.\"\n\n\"Yes, mother.\"\n\n\"Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and, in\nany perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don't get despondent\nor do rash things; write to me often, and be my brave girl, ready to\nhelp and cheer us all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be\nfaithful to the little home duties; and you, Amy, help all you can, be\nobedient, and keep happy safe at home.\"\n\n\"We will, mother! we will!\"\n\nThe rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen.\nThat was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well: no one cried, no\none ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very\nheavy as they sent loving messages to father, remembering, as they\nspoke, that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their\nmother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands\ncheerfully when she drove away.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
