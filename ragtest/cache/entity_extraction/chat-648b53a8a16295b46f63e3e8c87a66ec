Shall I call mother?\"\n\nBeth did not answer the first question; but in the dark one hand went\ninvoluntarily to her heart, as if the pain were there; with the other\nshe held Jo fast, whispering eagerly, \"No, no, don't call her, don't\ntell her. I shall be better soon. Lie down here and 'poor' my head. I'll\nbe quiet, and go to sleep; indeed I will.\"\n\nJo obeyed; but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth's hot\nforehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full, and she longed to\nspeak. But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,\ncannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally; so, though she\nbelieved she knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she only said, in her\ntenderest tone, \"Does anything trouble you, deary?\"\n\n\"Yes, Jo,\" after a long pause.\n\n\"Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"Not now, not yet.\"\n\n\"Then I won't ask; but remember, Bethy, that mother and Jo are always\nglad to hear and help you, if they can.\"\n\n\"I know it. I'll tell you by and by.\"\n\n\"Is the pain better now?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, much better; you are so comfortable, Jo!\"\n\n\"Go to sleep, dear; I'll stay with you.\"\n\nSo cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite\nherself again; for at eighteen, neither heads nor hearts ache long, and\na loving word can medicine most ills.\n\nBut Jo had made up her mind, and, after pondering over a project for\nsome days, she confided it to her mother.\n\n\"You asked me the other day what my wishes were. I'll tell you one of\nthem, Marmee,\" she began, as they sat alone together. \"I want to go away\nsomewhere this winter for a change.\"\n\n\"Why, Jo?\" and her mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested a\ndouble meaning.\n\nWith her eyes on her work, Jo answered soberly, \"I want something new; I\nfeel restless, and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning more than I\nam. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring up,\nso, as I can be spared this winter, I'd like to hop a little way, and\ntry my wings.\"\n\n\"Where will you hop?\"\n\n\"To New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. You know\nMrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her\nchildren and sew. It's rather hard to find just the thing, but I think I\nshould suit if I tried.\"\n\n\"My dear, go out to service in that great boarding-house!\" and Mrs.\nMarch looked surprised, but not displeased.\n\n\"It's not exactly going out to service; for Mrs. Kirke is your\nfriend,--the kindest soul that ever lived,--and would make things\npleasant for me, I know. Her family is separate from the rest, and no\none knows me there. Don't care if they do; it's honest work, and I'm not\nashamed of it.\"\n\n\"Nor I; but your writing?\"\n\n\"All the better for the change. I shall see and hear new things, get new\nideas, and, even if I haven't much time there, I shall bring home\nquantities of material for my rubbish.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it; but are these your only reasons for this sudden\nfancy?\"\n\n\"No, mother.\"\n\n\"May I know the others?\"\n\nJo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in\nher cheeks, \"It may be vain and wrong to say it, but--I'm afraid--Laurie\nis getting too fond of me.\"\n\n\"Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care\nfor you?\" and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the question.\n\n\"Mercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely\nproud of him; but as for anything more, it's out of the question.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that, Jo.\"\n\n\"Why, please?\"\n\n\"Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another. As friends you\nare very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over; but I fear\nyou would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much alike\nand too\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
