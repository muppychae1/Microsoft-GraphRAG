But she certainly did grow a little pale\nand pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society, and went\nout sketching alone a good deal. She never had much to show when she\ncame home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while she sat for hours,\nwith her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched\nany fancy that occurred to her,--a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a\nyoung man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a\ncurly-haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a ball-room on the\narm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur according to the\nlast fashion in art, which was safe, but not altogether satisfactory.\n\nHer aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred; and, finding\ndenials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what\nshe liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to\nEgypt. That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he\nsaid to himself, with a venerable air,--\n\n\"I was sure she would think better of it. Poor old fellow! I've been\nthrough it all, and I can sympathize.\"\n\nWith that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his\nduty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa, and enjoyed Amy's letter\nluxuriously.\n\nWhile these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home; but\nthe letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and when the\nnext found her, the grass was green above her sister. The sad news met\nher at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they\nhad travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian\nlakes. She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the family decree\nthat she should not shorten her visit, for, since it was too late to say\ngood-by to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence soften her sorrow.\nBut her heart was very heavy; she longed to be at home, and every day\nlooked wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and comfort\nher.\n\nHe did come very soon; for the same mail brought letters to them both,\nbut he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him. The moment he\nread it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow-pedestrians,\nand was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow,\nhope and suspense.\n\nHe knew Vevay well; and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he\nhurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living _en\npension_. The _garçon_ was in despair that the whole family had gone to\ntake a promenade on the lake; but no, the blond mademoiselle might be in\nthe chateau garden. If monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting\ndown, a flash of time should present her. But monsieur could not wait\neven \"a flash of time,\" and, in the middle of the speech, departed to\nfind mademoiselle himself.\n\nA pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts\nrustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the\ntower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of the wide, low\nwall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or console\nherself with the beauty all about her. She was sitting here that day,\nleaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes,\nthinking of Beth, and wondering why Laurie did not come. She did not\nhear him cross the court-yard beyond, nor see him pause in the archway\nthat led from the subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute,\nlooking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen\nbefore,--the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely\nsuggested love and sorrow,--the blotted letters in her lap, the black\nribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face;\neven the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for\nhe had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had\nany doubts about the reception she would give him, they were set at\nrest the minute she looked up and saw him; for, dropping everything, she\nran to him, exclaiming, in a tone of unmistakable love and longing,--\n\n\"O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!\"\n\n          [Illustration: O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come]\n\nI think everything was said and settled then; for, as they stood\ntogether quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down\nprotectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and\nsustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only\nwoman in the world who could fill Jo's place, and make him happy. He did\nnot tell her so; but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth,\nwere satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.\n\nIn a minute Amy went back to her place; and, while she dried her tears,\nLaurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry\nwell\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
