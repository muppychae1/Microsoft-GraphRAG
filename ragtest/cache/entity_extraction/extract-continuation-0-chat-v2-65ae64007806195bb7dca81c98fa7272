She could not\nroam about and amuse herself, for the burnt breadth would show, so she\nstared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked\nat once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would\nhave guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big\nred-headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage\nher, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy\nherself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the\nsame refuge; for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face\nto face with the \"Laurence boy.\"\n\n           [Illustration: Face to face with the Laurence boy]\n\n\"Dear me, I didn't know any one was here!\" stammered Jo, preparing to\nback out as speedily as she had bounced in.\n\nBut the boy laughed, and said pleasantly, though he looked a little\nstartled,--\n\n\"Don't mind me; stay, if you like.\"\n\n\"Sha'n't I disturb you?\"\n\n\"Not a bit; I only came here because I don't know many people, and felt\nrather strange at first, you know.\"\n\n\"So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.\"\n\nThe boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to\nbe polite and easy,--\n\n\"I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before; you live near us,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"Next door\"; and he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim manner\nwas rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket\nwhen he brought the cat home.\n\nThat put Jo at her ease; and she laughed too, as she said, in her\nheartiest way,--\n\n\"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.\"\n\n\"Grandpa sent it.\"\n\n\"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?\"\n\n\"How is your cat, Miss March?\" asked the boy, trying to look sober,\nwhile his black eyes shone with fun.\n\n\"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence; but I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo,\"\nreturned the young lady.\n\n\"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.\"\n\n\"Laurie Laurence,--what an odd name!\"\n\n\"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called\nme Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\"\n\n\"I hate my name, too--so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo,\ninstead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\"\n\n\"I thrashed 'em.\"\n\n\"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it\"; and\nJo resigned herself with a sigh.\n\n\"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?\" asked Laurie, looking as if he\nthought the name suited her.\n\n\"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and every one is\nlively. In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on\npeople's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief, and\nlet Meg sail about. Don't you dance?\"\n\n\"Sometimes; you see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't been\ninto company enough yet to know how you do things here.\"\n\n\"Abroad!\" cried Jo. \"Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people\ndescribe their travels.\"\n\nLaurie didn't seem to know where to begin; but Jo's eager questions soon\nset him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where\nthe boys never wore hats, and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for\nholiday fun went walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.\n\n\"Don't I wish I'd been there!\" cried Jo. \"Did you go to Paris?\"\n\n\"We spent last winter there.\"\n\n\"Can you talk French?\"\n\n\"We were not allowed to speak any thing else at Vevay.\"\n\n\"Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce.\"\n\n\"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\" said Laurie\ngood-naturedly.\n\n\"How nicely you do it! Let me see,--you said, 'Who is the young lady in\nthe pretty slippers,' didn't you?\"\n\n\"Oui, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is\npretty?\"\n\n\"Yes; she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and\nquiet, and dances like a lady.\"\n\nJo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and\nstored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticised and chatted,\ntill they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon wore\noff; for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and\nJo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten, and nobody\nlifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the \"Laurence boy\" better than\never, and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him\nto the girls; for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys\nwere almost unknown creatures to them.\n\n\"Curly black hair; brown skin; big, black eyes; handsome nose; fine\nteeth; small hands and feet; taller than I am; very polite, for a boy,\nand altogether jolly.
