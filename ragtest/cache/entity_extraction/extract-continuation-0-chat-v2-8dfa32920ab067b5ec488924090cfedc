They crimped and curled\nher hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,\ntouched her lips with coralline salve, to make them redder, and Hortense\nwould have added \"a _soupçon_ of rouge,\" if Meg had not rebelled. They\nlaced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly\nbreathe, and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in\nthe mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,\nbrooch, and even ear-rings, for Hortense tied them on, with a bit of\npink silk, which did not show. A cluster of tea-rosebuds at the bosom,\nand a _ruche_, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty white\nshoulders, and a pair of high-heeled blue silk boots satisfied the last\nwish of her heart. A laced handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a\nsilver holder finished her off; and Miss Belle surveyed her with the\nsatisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.\n\n\"Mademoiselle is charmante, très jolie, is she not?\" cried Hortense,\nclasping her hands in an affected rapture.\n\n\"Come and show yourself,\" said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room\nwhere the others were waiting.\n\nAs Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her ear-rings\ntinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her\n\"fun\" had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that\nshe _was_ \"a little beauty.\" Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase\nenthusiastically; and, for several minutes, she stood, like the jackdaw\nin the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered\nlike a party of magpies.\n\n\"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt,\nand those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take your silver\nbutterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,\nClara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,\" said\nBelle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.\n\n\"I'm afraid to go down, I feel so queer and stiff and half-dressed,\"\nsaid Meg to Sallie, as the bell rang, and Mrs. Moffat sent to ask the\nyoung ladies to appear at once.\n\n\"You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere\nbeside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I\nassure you. Let your flowers hang; don't be so careful of them, and be\nsure you don't trip,\" returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was\nprettier than herself.\n\n                 [Illustration: Asked to be introduced]\n\nKeeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs,\nand sailed into the drawing-rooms, where the Moffats and a few early\nguests were assembled. She very soon discovered that there is a charm\nabout fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people, and secures\ntheir respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her\nbefore, were very affectionate all of a sudden; several young gentlemen,\nwho had only stared at her at the other party, now not only stared, but\nasked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but agreeable\nthings to her; and several old ladies, who sat on sofas, and criticised\nthe rest of the party, inquired who she was, with an air of interest.\nShe heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them,--\n\n\"Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,\nbut reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;\nsweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another\nobservation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard, and been\nrather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs.\n\nThe \"queer feeling\" did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting\nthe new part of fine lady, and so got on pretty well, though the tight\ndress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and\nshe was in constant fear lest her ear-rings should fly off, and get lost\nor broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of\na young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped\nlaughing and looked confused; for, just opposite, she saw Laurie. He was\nstaring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she\nthought; for, though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest\neyes made her blush, and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her\nconfusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to\nLaurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CINDERELLA<|>PERSON<|>Cinderella is a fictional character known for attending a ball with the help of her godmother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLE<|>PERSON<|>Belle is a character persuading Meg to attend a ball)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a character who is persuaded to attend a ball and undergoes a transformation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOFFATS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Moffats are a group of individuals involved in the transformation of Meg)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THURSDAY<|>EVENT<|>Thursday is the day when the transformation of Meg takes place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HORTENSE<|>PERSON<|>Hortense is involved in the transformation of Meg)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAN<|>PERSON<|>Nan is instructed to help Meg with her skirt and heels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLARA<|>PERSON<|>Clara is instructed to help Meg with her hair)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALLIE<|>PERSON<|>Sallie is a friend of Meg who comments on her appearance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
