It was really amazing, for every one seemed in a heavenly\nframe of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved of their\nfirst anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed their\npraiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into the old ways.\nThey did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to\ngrow easier; and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that\nEndeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.\n\nJo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough, and\nwas ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March didn't\nlike to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked this, and\nafter an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa\nto nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found that housework and\nart did not go well together, and returned to her mud pies. Meg went\ndaily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much\ntime was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the\nWashington despatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight\nrelapses into idleness or grieving. All the little duties were\nfaithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were\nforgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone\na-visiting. When her heart got heavy with longings for mother or fears\nfor father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the\nfolds of a certain dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed\nher little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up\nafter a sober fit, but every one felt how sweet and helpful Beth was,\nand fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small\naffairs.\n\nAll were unconscious that this experience was a test of character; and,\nwhen the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well, and\ndeserved praise. So they did; but their mistake was in ceasing to do\nwell, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.\n\n\"Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels; you know mother told us not\nto forget them,\" said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's departure.\n\n\"I'm too tired to go this afternoon,\" replied Meg, rocking comfortably\nas she sewed.\n\n\"Can't you, Jo?\" asked Beth.\n\n\"Too stormy for me with my cold.\"\n\n\"I thought it was almost well.\"\n\n\"It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to\ngo to the Hummels',\" said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of\nher inconsistency.\n\n\"Why don't you go yourself?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"I _have_ been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't know what to\ndo for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of it;\nbut it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to go.\"\n\nBeth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go to-morrow.\n\n\"Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth; the air\nwill do you good,\" said Jo, adding apologetically, \"I'd go, but I want\nto finish my writing.\"\n\n\"My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought may be some of you would go,\"\nsaid Beth.\n\n\"Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,\" suggested Meg.\n\n\"Well, I'll rest a little and wait for her.\"\n\nSo Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and the\nHummels were forgotten. An hour passed: Amy did not come; Meg went to\nher room to try on a new dress; Jo was absorbed in her story, and Hannah\nwas sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly put on her\nhood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children, and\nwent out into the chilly air, with a heavy head, and a grieved look in\nher patient eyes. It was late when she came\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
