A pleasant green field, with three\nwide-spreading oaks in the middle, and a smooth strip of turf for\ncroquet.\n\n\"Welcome to Camp Laurence!\" said the young host, as they landed, with\nexclamations of delight.\n\n\"Brooke is commander-in-chief; I am commissary-general; the other\nfellows are staff-officers; and you, ladies, are company. The tent is\nfor your especial benefit, and that oak is your drawing-room; this is\nthe mess-room, and the third is the camp-kitchen. Now, let's have a game\nbefore it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner.\"\n\nFrank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the\nother eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred; Laurie took Sallie,\nJo, and Ned. The Englishers played well; but the Americans played\nbetter, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the\nspirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes, and\nonce narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket, and\nhad missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was\nclose behind her, and his turn came before hers; he gave a stroke, his\nball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was\nvery near; and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\ntoe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\n\n\"I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,\" cried\nthe young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.\n\n             [Illustration: Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you]\n\n\"You pushed it; I saw you; it's my turn now,\" said Jo sharply.\n\n\"Upon my word, I didn't move it; it rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\nallowed; so stand off, please, and let me have a go at the stake.\"\n\n\"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\" said Jo\nangrily.\n\n\"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!\"\nreturned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.\n\nJo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,\ncolored up to her forehead, and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\nwith all her might, while Fred hit the stake, and declared himself out\nwith much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time\nfinding it, among the bushes; but she came back, looking cool and quiet,\nand waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the\nplace she had lost; and, when she got there, the other side had nearly\nwon, for Kate's ball was the last but one, and lay near the stake.\n\n\"By George, it's all up with us! Good-by, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so\nyou are finished,\" cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see\nthe finish.\n\n\"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\" said Jo, with\na look that made the lad redden, \"especially when they beat them,\" she\nadded, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a clever\nstroke.\n\nLaurie threw up his hat; then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult\nover the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of a cheer to\nwhisper to his friend,--\n\n\"Good for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw him; we can't tell him so, but he\nwon't do it again, take my word for it.\"\n\nMeg drew her aside, under pretence of pinning up a loose braid, and said\napprovingly,--\n\n\"It was dreadfully provoking; but you kept your temper, and I'm so glad,\nJo.\"\n\n\"Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should\ncertainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the nettles till I\ngot my rage under enough to hold my tongue. It's simmering now, so I\nhope he'll keep out of my way,\" returned Jo, biting her lips, as she\nglowered at Fred from under her big hat.\n\n\"Time for lunch,\" said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch.\n\"Commissary-general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss\nMarch, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good coffee?\"\n\n\"Jo can,\" said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So Jo, feeling that\nher late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over\nthe coffee-pot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys\nmade a fire, and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched,\nand Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes\nto serve as plates.\n\nThe commander-in-chief and his aids soon spread the table-cloth with an\ninviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green\nleaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and every one settled\nthemselves to a hearty meal; for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise\ndevelops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was; for everything\nseemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a\nvenerable\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Camp Laurence is a recreational camp with various activities and facilities for guests)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROOKE<|>PERSON<|>Brooke is the commander-in-chief at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a staff officer at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATE<|>PERSON<|>Kate is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRED<|>PERSON<|>Fred is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALLIE<|>PERSON<|>Sallie is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NED<|>PERSON<|>Ned is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANK<|>PERSON<|>Frank is a spectator at the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is a spectator at the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a spectator at the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRACE<|>PERSON<|>Grace is a spectator at the croquet game at Camp Laurence)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROOKE<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Brooke is the commander-in-chief at Camp Laurence<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Laurie is a staff officer at Camp Laurence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Meg is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATE<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Kate is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRED<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Fred is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALLIE<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Sallie is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Jo is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Ned is a player in the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Frank is a spectator at the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Beth is a spectator at the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Amy is a spectator at the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRACE<|>CAMP LAURENCE<|>Grace is a spectator at the croquet game at Camp Laurence<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
