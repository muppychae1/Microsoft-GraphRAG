I never thought it would\ngo where it could tell tales,\" said Jo, tearing up the verses the\nProfessor had treasured so long.\n\n\"Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I read\nall the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets,\" said Mr.\nBhaer, with a smile, as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind.\n\"Yes,\" he added earnestly, \"I read that, and I think to myself, 'She has\na sorrow, she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love. I haf a\nheart full, full for her; shall I not go and say, 'If this is not too\npoor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive, take it in Gott's\nname?'\"\n\n\"And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one precious\nthing I needed,\" whispered Jo.\n\n\"I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was your\nwelcome to me. But soon I began to hope, and then I said, 'I will haf\nher if I die for it,' and so I will!\" cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defiant\nnod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he\nwas to surmount or valiantly knock down.\n\nJo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight,\nthough he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.\n\n\"What made you stay away so long?\" she asked presently, finding it so\npleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that\nshe could not keep silent.\n\n\"It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that\nso happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to give you, after\nmuch time, perhaps, and hard work. How could I ask you to gif up so much\nfor a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?\"\n\n\"I'm glad you _are_ poor; I couldn't bear a rich husband,\" said Jo\ndecidedly, adding, in a softer tone, \"Don't fear poverty; I've known it\nlong enough to lose my dread, and be happy working for those I love; and\ndon't call yourself old,--forty is the prime of life. I couldn't help\nloving you if you were seventy!\"\n\nThe Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his\nhandkerchief, if he could have got at it; as he couldn't, Jo wiped his\neyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away a bundle or two,--\n\n\"I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my sphere now,\nfor woman's special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing\nburdens. I'm to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn the home.\nMake up your mind to that, or I'll never go,\" she added resolutely, as\nhe tried to reclaim his load.\n\n\"We shall see. Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go away\nand do my work alone. I must help my boys first, because, even for you,\nI may not break my word to Minna. Can you forgif that, and be happy\nwhile we hope and wait?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know I can; for we love one another, and that makes all the rest\neasy to bear. I have my duty, also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself\nif I neglected them even for you, so there's no need of hurry or\nimpatience. You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and both\nbe happy hoping for the best, and leaving the future to be as God\nwills.\"\n\n\"Ah! thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing to gif back\nbut a full heart and these empty hands,\" cried the Professor, quite\novercome.\n\n                   [Illustration: Under the umbrella]\n\nJo never, never would learn to be proper; for when he said that as they\nstood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, whispering\ntenderly, \"Not empty now;\" and, stooping down, kissed her Friedrich\nunder the umbrella. It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the\nflock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings, for\nshe was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything but her\nown happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that was the\ncrowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the night and\nstorm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting\nto receive them, with a glad \"Welcome home!\" Jo led her lover in, and\nshut the door.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                      [Illustration: Harvest time]\n\n                                 XLVII.\n\n                             HARVEST TIME.\n\n\nFor a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met\noccasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the\nprice of paper was accounted for, Laurie said.
