Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is more\nconvenient; so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important\nsubject,\" said Jo, calling a family council.\n\n\"Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,\nand the idea is well worked out. Let it wait and ripen,\" was her\nfather's advice; and he practised as he preached, having waited\npatiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no\nhaste to gather it, even now, when it was sweet and mellow.\n\n\"It seems to me that Jo will profit more by making the trial than by\nwaiting,\" said Mrs. March. \"Criticism is the best test of such work, for\nit will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her to do\nbetter next time. We are too partial; but the praise and blame of\noutsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jo, knitting her brows, \"that's just it; I've been fussing\nover the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or\nindifferent. It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons\ntake a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't leave out a word of it; you'll spoil it if you do, for the\ninterest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the\npeople, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on,\"\nsaid Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable\nnovel ever written.\n\n\"But Mr. Allen says, 'Leave out the explanations, make it brief and\ndramatic, and let the characters tell the story,'\" interrupted Jo,\nturning to the publisher's note.\n\n\"Do as he tells you; he knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a good,\npopular book, and get as much money as you can. By and by, when, you've\ngot a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical and\nmetaphysical people in your novels,\" said Amy, who took a strictly\npractical view of the subject.\n\n\"Well,\" said Jo, laughing, \"if my people _are_ 'philosophical and\nmetaphysical,' it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,\nexcept what I hear father say, sometimes. If I've got some of his wise\nideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me. Now, Beth,\nwhat do you say?\"\n\n\"I should so like to see it printed _soon_,\" was all Beth said, and\nsmiled in saying it; but there was an unconscious emphasis on the last\nword, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike\ncandor, which chilled Jo's heart, for a minute, with a foreboding fear,\nand decided her to make her little venture \"soon.\"\n\nSo, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on\nher table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre. In the hope of\npleasing every one, she took every one's advice; and, like the old man\nand his donkey in the fable, suited nobody.\n\nHer father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got\ninto it; so that was allowed to remain, though she had her doubts about\nit. Her mother thought that there _was_ a trifle too much description;\nout, therefore, it nearly all came, and with it many necessary links in\nthe story. Meg admired the tragedy; so Jo piled up the agony to suit\nher, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in\nlife, Jo quenched the sprightly scenes which relieved the sombre\ncharacter of the story. Then, to complete the ruin, she cut it down one\nthird, and confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked\nrobin, out into the big, busy world, to try its fate.\n\nWell, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it; likewise\nplenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she expected that\nshe was thrown into a state of bewilderment, from which it took her some\ntime to recover.\n\n\"You said, mother, that criticism would help me; but how can it, when\nit's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising\nbook or broken all the ten commandments?\" cried poor Jo, turning over a\nheap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one\nminute, wrath and dire dismay the next. \"This man says 'An exquisite\nbook, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and\nhealthy,'\" continued the perplexed authoress. \"The next, 'The theory of\nthe book is bad, full of morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, and\nunnatural characters.' Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don't\nbelieve in Spiritualism, and copied my characters from life, I don't see\nhow this critic _can_ be right.
