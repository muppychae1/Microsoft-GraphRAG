She read\nthe short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me\nwhen I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an ugly\nname, and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace and\nfun, and cosy times together. I see it all! they'll go lovering around\nthe house, and we shall have to dodge; Meg will be absorbed, and no good\nto me any more; Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off,\nand make a hole in the family; and I shall break my heart, and\neverything will be abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! why weren't we\nall boys, then there wouldn't be any bother.\"\n\nJo leaned her chin on her knees, in a disconsolate attitude, and shook\nher fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked up\nwith an air of relief.\n\n\"You don't like it, mother? I'm glad of it. Let's send him about his\nbusiness, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as we\nalways have been.\"\n\n\"I did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all go to\nhomes of your own, in time; but I do want to keep my girls as long as I\ncan; and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only\nseventeen, and it will be some years before John can make a home for\nher. Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in\nany way, nor be married, before twenty. If she and John love one\nanother, they can wait, and test the love by doing so. She is\nconscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly. My\npretty, tender-hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her.\"\n\n\"Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man?\" asked Jo, as her mother's\nvoice faltered a little over the last words.\n\n\"Money is a good and useful thing, Jo; and I hope my girls will never\nfeel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much. I should\nlike to know that John was firmly established in some good business,\nwhich gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make\nMeg comfortable. I'm not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable\nposition, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money come with\nlove and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your\ngood fortune; but I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can\nbe had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and\nsome privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see\nMeg begin humbly, for, if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the\npossession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a fortune.\"\n\n\"I understand, mother, and quite agree; but I'm disappointed about Meg,\nfor I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by and by, and sit in the lap of\nluxury all her days. Wouldn't it be nice?\" asked Jo, looking up, with a\nbrighter face.\n\n\"He is younger than she, you know,\" began Mrs. March; but Jo broke in,--\n\n\"Only a little; he's old for his age, and tall; and can be quite\ngrown-up in his manners if he likes. Then he's rich and generous and\ngood, and loves us all; and _I_ say it's a pity my plan is spoilt.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown up enough for Meg, and altogether too\nmuch of a weathercock, just now, for any one to depend on. Don't make\nplans, Jo; but let time and their own hearts mate your friends. We can't\nmeddle safely in such matters, and had better not get 'romantic\nrubbish,' as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't; but I hate to see things going all criss-cross and\ngetting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten\nit out. I wish wearing flat-irons on our heads would keep us from\ngrowing up. But buds will be roses, and kittens, cats,--more's the\npity!\"\n\n\"What's that about flat-irons and cats?\" asked Meg, as she crept into\nthe room, with the finished letter in her hand.\n\n\"Only one of my stupid speeches. I'm going to bed; come, Peggy,\" said\nJo, unfolding herself, like an animated puzzle.\n\n\"Quite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my love to\nJohn,\" said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter, and gave it\nback.\n\n\"Do you call him 'John'?\" asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes\nlooking down into her mother's.\n\n\"Yes; he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,\"\nreplied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.\n\n\"I'm glad of that, he is so lonely. Good-night, mother, dear. It is so\ninexpressibly comfortable to have you here,\" was Meg's quiet answer.\n\nThe kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one; and, as she went\naway, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, \"She\ndoes not love John yet, but will\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
