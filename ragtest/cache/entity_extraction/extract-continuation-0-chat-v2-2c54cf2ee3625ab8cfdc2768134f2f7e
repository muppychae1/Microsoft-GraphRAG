Did you ever see such\nroses?\" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a\nluxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.\n\n\"No, nor felt such thorns,\" returned Laurie, with his thumb in his\nmouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that\ngrew just beyond his reach.\n\n\"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,\" said Amy,\ngathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall\nbehind her. She put them in his button-hole, as a peace-offering, and he\nstood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in\nthe Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and\nhe was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,\nwhen imaginative young men find significance in trifles, and food for\nromance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny\nred rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like\nthat from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him were the\nsort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths, and,\nfor a moment, he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself; but the\nnext instant his American common-sense got the better of sentimentality,\nand he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard since he came.\n\n\"It's good advice; you'd better take it and save your fingers,\" she\nsaid, thinking her speech amused him.\n\n\"Thank you, I will,\" he answered in jest, and a few months later he did\nit in earnest.\n\n\"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?\" she asked presently,\nas she settled herself on a rustic seat.\n\n\"Very soon.\"\n\n\"You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.\"\n\n\"I dare say; short answers save trouble.\"\n\n\"He expects you, and you really ought to go.\"\n\n\"Hospitable creature! I know it.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you do it?\"\n\n\"Natural depravity, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Natural indolence, you mean. It's really dreadful!\" and Amy looked\nsevere.\n\n\"Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I\nmight as well stay, and plague you a little longer, you can bear it\nbetter; in fact, I think it agrees with you excellently;\" and Laurie\ncomposed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.\n\nAmy shook her head, and opened her sketch-book with an air of\nresignation; but she had made up her mind to lecture \"that boy,\" and in\na minute she began again.\n\n\"What are you doing just now?\"\n\n\"Watching lizards.\"\n\n\"No, no; I mean what do you intend and wish to do?\"\n\n\"Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me.\"\n\n\"How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars, and I will only allow\nit on condition that you let me put you into my sketch; I need a\nfigure.\"\n\n\"With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me,--full-length or\nthree-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should respectfully suggest a\nrecumbent posture, then put yourself in also, and call it '_Dolce far\nniente._'\"\n\n\"Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. _I_ intend to work hard,\"\nsaid Amy, in her most energetic tone.\n\n\"What delightful enthusiasm!\" and he leaned against a tall urn with an\nair of entire satisfaction.\n\n\"What would Jo say if she saw you now?\" asked Amy impatiently, hoping to\nstir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name.\n\n\"As usual, 'Go away, Teddy, I'm busy!'\" He laughed as he spoke, but the\nlaugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the\nutterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed\nyet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them\nbefore, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on\nLaurie's face,--a hard, bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and\nregret. It was gone before she could study it, and the listless\nexpression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic\npleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in\nthe sun with uncovered head, and eyes full of southern dreaminess; for\nhe seemed to have forgotten her, and fallen into a reverie.\n\n\"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,\" she\nsaid, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark\nstone.\n\n\"Wish I was!\"\n\n\"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoilt your life. You are so\nchanged, I sometimes think--\" there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,\nhalf-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.\n\nLaurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated\nto express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used to\nsay it to her mother,--\n\n\"It's all right, ma'am.\"\n\nThat satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry\nher lately. It also touched her, and she showed that\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MEDITERRANEAN<|>GEO<|>The Mediterranean is a sea that can be viewed from the terrace)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE-WALLED CITY<|>GEO<|>City visible from the terrace)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a character who enjoys the view from the terrace)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character who tries to capture a scarlet flower)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN<|>GEO<|>Reference to Laurie's Italian heritage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Character mentioned in relation to flowers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN<|>GEO<|>Reference to Laurie's American common-sense)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSTIC SEAT<|>GEO<|>Seat where Amy settles herself)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIZARDS<|>GEO<|>Animals Laurie is watching)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKETCH-BOOK<|>GEO<|>Item Amy opens with resignation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEDDY<|>PERSON<|>Nickname mentioned in conversation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SISTER<|>PERSON<|>Reference to Jo)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>LAURIE<|>Amy is interacting with Laurie on the terrace<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>LAURIE<|>Jo is mentioned in relation to Laurie's behavior<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>JO<|>Amy mentions Jo in conversation<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
