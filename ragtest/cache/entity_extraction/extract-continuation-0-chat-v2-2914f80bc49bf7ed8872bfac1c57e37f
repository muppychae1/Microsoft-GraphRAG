Jo, how could you?\" cried the three girls, as\nSnodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth; and, producing both a chair\nand a badge, installed him in a jiffy.\n\n\"The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,\" began Mr. Pickwick, trying\nto get up an awful frown, and only succeeding in producing an amiable\nsmile. But the new member was equal to the occasion; and, rising, with a\ngrateful salutation to the Chair, said, in the most engaging manner,\n\"Mr. President and ladies,--I beg pardon, gentlemen,--allow me to\nintroduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble servant of the club.\"\n\n\"Good! good!\" cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming-pan\non which she leaned.\n\n\"My faithful friend and noble patron,\" continued Laurie, with a wave of\nthe hand, \"who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed for\nthe base stratagem of to-night. I planned it, and she only gave in after\nlots of teasing.\"\n\n\"Come now, don't lay it all on yourself; you know I proposed the\ncupboard,\" broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.\n\n\"Never you mind what she says. I'm the wretch that did it, sir,\" said\nthe new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. \"But on my\nhonor, I never will do so again, and henceforth _dewote_ myself to the\ninterest of this immortal club.\"\n\n\"Hear! hear!\" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming-pan like a\ncymbal.\n\n\"Go on, go on!\" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed\nbenignly.\n\n\"I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the\nhonor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between\nadjoining nations, I have set up a post-office in the hedge in the lower\ncorner of the garden; a fine, spacious building, with padlocks on the\ndoors, and every convenience for the mails,--also the females, if I may\nbe allowed the expression. It's the old martin-house; but I've stopped\nup the door, and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts of\nthings, and save our valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books, and\nbundles can be passed in there; and, as each nation has a key, it will\nbe uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key; and,\nwith many thanks for your favor, take my seat.\"\n\nGreat applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table, and\nsubsided; the warming-pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some time\nbefore order could be restored. A long discussion followed, and every\none came out surprising, for every one did her best; so it was an\nunusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it\nbroke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.\n\nNo one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,\nwell-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did add\n\"spirit\" to the meetings, and \"a tone\" to the paper; for his orations\nconvulsed his hearers, and his contributions were excellent, being\npatriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental. Jo\nregarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or Shakespeare; and remodelled\nher own works with good effect, she thought.\n\nThe P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished wonderfully,\nfor nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real\noffice. Tragedies and cravats, poetry and pickles, garden-seeds and long\nletters, music and gingerbread, rubbers, invitations, scoldings and\npuppies. The old gentleman liked the fun, and amused himself by sending\nodd bundles, mysterious messages, and funny telegrams; and his gardener,\nwho was smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love-letter to\nJo's care. How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming how\nmany love-letters that little post-office would hold in the years to\ncome!\n\n\n\n\n           [Illustration: Jo spent the morning on the river]\n\n                                  XI.\n\n                              EXPERIMENTS.\n\n\n\"The first of June!

Three months' vacation,--how I shall enjoy it!\" exclaimed Meg,\ncoming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual\nstate of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and Amy made\nlemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.\n\n\"Aunt March went to-day, for which, oh, be joyful!\" said Jo. \"I was\nmortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her; if she had, I should have\nfelt as if I ought to do it; but Plumfield is about as gay as a\nchurchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused.
