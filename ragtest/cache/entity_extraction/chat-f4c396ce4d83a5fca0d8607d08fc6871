I longed to show them a tearing American gallop, for they\n    trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant habits and high\n    hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah's Ark. Every one\n    rides,--old men, stout ladies, little children,--and the young\n    folks do a deal of flirting here; I saw a pair exchange\n    rosebuds, for it's the thing to wear one in the button-hole, and\n    I thought it rather a nice little idea.\n\n    \"In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey; but don't expect me to\n    describe it, that's impossible--so I'll only say it was sublime!\n    This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will be an\n    appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.\n\n                                                          \"MIDNIGHT.\n\n    \"It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning\n    without telling you what happened last evening. Who do you think\n    came in, as we were at tea? Laurie's English friends, Fred and\n    Frank Vaughn! I was _so_ surprised, for I shouldn't have known\n    them but for the cards. Both are tall fellows, with whiskers;\n    Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better, for\n    he only limps slightly, and uses no crutches. They had heard\n    from Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their\n    house; but uncle won't go, so we shall return the call, and see\n    them as we can. They went to the theatre with us, and we did\n    have _such_ a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and\n    Fred and I talked over past, present, and future fun as if we\n    had known each other all our days. Tell Beth Frank asked for\n    her, and was sorry to hear of her ill health. Fred laughed when\n    I spoke of Jo, and sent his 'respectful compliments to the big\n    hat.' Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we\n    had there. What ages ago it seems, doesn't it?\n\n    \"Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I _must_\n    stop. I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing\n    here so late, with my room full of pretty things, and my head a\n    jumble of parks, theatres, new gowns, and gallant creatures who\n    say 'Ah!' and twirl their blond mustaches with the true English\n    lordliness. I long to see you all, and in spite of my nonsense\n    am, as ever, your loving\n                                                               AMY.\"\n\n\n    \"DEAR GIRLS,--                                           \"PARIS.\n\n    \"In my last I told you about our London visit,--how kind the\n    Vaughns were, and what pleasant parties they made for us. I\n    enjoyed the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum\n    more than anything else,--for at Hampton I saw Raphael's\n    cartoons, and, at the Museum, rooms full of pictures by Turner,\n    Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great creatures. The\n    day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular English\n    picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I\n    could copy; also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up. We\n    'did' London to our hearts' content, thanks to Fred and Frank,\n    and were sorry to go away; for, though English people are slow\n    to take you in, when they once make up their minds to do it they\n    cannot be outdone in hospitality, _I_ think. The Vaughns hope to\n    meet us in Rome next winter, and I shall be dreadfully\n    disappointed if they don't, for Grace and I are great friends,\n    and the boys very nice fellows,--especially Fred.\n\n    \"Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again,\n    saying he had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland.\n    Aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about it she\n    couldn't say a word; and now we get on nicely, and are very glad\n    he came, for he speaks French like a native, and I don't know\n    what we should do without him. Uncle doesn't know ten words, and\n    insists on talking English very loud, as if that would make\n    people understand him. Aunt's pronunciation is old-fashioned,\n    and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good\n    deal, find we don't, and are very grateful to have Fred do the\n    '_parley vooing_,' as uncle calls it.\n\n    \"Such delightful times as we are having! sight-seeing from\n    morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay\n    _cafés_, and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures. Rainy\n    days I spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures. Jo would turn\n    up her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no\n    soul for art; but _I_ have, and I'm cultivating eye and taste as\n    fast as I can.
