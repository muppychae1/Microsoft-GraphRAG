Wrong-doing always brings its own punishment; and,\nwhen Jo most needed hers, she got it.\n\nI don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read\ncharacter, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,\nbrave, and strong; but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every\nperfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who interested\nher in spite of many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in one of their\nconversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and lovely\ncharacters, wherever she found them, as good training for a writer. Jo\ntook him at his word, for she coolly turned round and studied him,--a\nproceeding which would have much surprised him, had he known it, for the\nworthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.\n\nWhy everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first. He was neither\nrich nor great, young nor handsome; in no respect what is called\nfascinating, imposing, or brilliant; and yet he was as attractive as a\ngenial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about\na warm hearth. He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving something\naway; a stranger, yet every one was his friend; no longer young, but as\nhappy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face looked\nbeautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake.\nJo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and, at last,\ndecided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle. If he had any\nsorrow, \"it sat with its head under its wing,\" and he turned only his\nsunny side to the world. There were lines upon his forehead, but Time\nseemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to\nothers. The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many\nfriendly words and cheery laughs; his eyes were never cold or hard, and\nhis big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than\nwords.\n\nHis very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the\nwearer. They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him\ncomfortable; his capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart\nunderneath; his rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets\nplainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full;\nhis very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy\nlike other people's.\n\n\"That's it!\" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that\ngenuine good-will towards one's fellow-men could beautify and dignify\neven a stout German teacher, who shovelled in his dinner, darned his own\nsocks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.\n\nJo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine\nrespect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the\nProfessor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,\nand no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much\nhonored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came\nto see him, and, in a conversation with Miss Norton, divulged the\npleasing fact. From her Jo learned it, and liked it all the better\nbecause Mr. Bhaer had never told it. She felt proud to know that he was\nan honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in\nAmerica; and his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the\nspice of romance which this discovery gave it.\n\nAnother and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most\nunexpected manner. Miss Norton had the _entrée_ into literary society,\nwhich Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her. The solitary\nwoman felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many\nfavors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor. She took them with\nher, one night, to a select symposium, held in honor of several\ncelebrities.\n\n                   [Illustration: A select symposium]\n\nJo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had\nworshipped with youthful enthusiasm afar off. But her reverence for\ngenius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to\nrecover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and\nwomen after all. Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid\nadmiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on\n\"spirit, fire, and dew,\" to behold him devouring his supper with an\nardor which flushed his intellectual countenance. Turning as from a\nfallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her\nromantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated between two decanters\nwith the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with\none of the Madame de Staëls of the age, who looked daggers at another\nCorinne, who was amiably sat\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a young woman who values goodness and intellect, with a feminine respect for both)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
