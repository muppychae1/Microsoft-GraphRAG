Please say something nice; for she has tried so hard,\nand been so very, very good to me,\" said Beth, in her father's ear.\n\nHe laughed, and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an\nunusually mild expression in her brown face.\n\n\"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a year\nago,\" said Mr. March. \"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight,\nlaces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on\nthe rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale, just now,\nwith watching and anxiety; but I like to look at it, for it has grown\ngentler, and her voice is lower; she doesn't bounce, but moves quietly,\nand takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which\ndelights me. I rather miss my wild girl; but if I get a strong, helpful,\ntender-hearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don't\nknow whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in\nall Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought\nwith the five-and-twenty dollars which my good girl sent me.\"\n\nJo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy\nin the firelight, as she received her father's praise, feeling that she\ndid deserve a portion of it.\n\n\"Now Beth,\" said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.\n\n\"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will\nslip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,\" began\ntheir father cheerfully; but recollecting how nearly he _had_ lost her,\nhe held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own,\n\"I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God.\"\n\nAfter a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket\nat his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair,--\n\n\"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her\nmother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place to-night, and has waited\non every one with patience and good-humor. I also observe that she does\nnot fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very\npretty ring which she wears; so I conclude that she has learned to think\nof other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and\nmould her character as carefully as she moulds her little clay figures.\nI am glad of this; for though I should be very proud of a graceful\nstatue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter,\nwith a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking of, Beth?\" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her\nfather and told about her ring.\n\n\"I read in 'Pilgrim's Progress' to-day, how, after many troubles,\nChristian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow, where lilies\nbloomed all the year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,\nbefore they went on to their journey's end,\" answered Beth; adding, as\nshe slipped out of her father's arms, and went slowly to the instrument,\n\"It's singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I'll try to\nsing the song of the shepherd-boy which the Pilgrims heard. I made the\nmusic for father, because he likes the verses.\"\n\nSo, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and,\nin the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sung to her own\naccompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song for\nher:--\n\n        \"He that is down need fear no fall,\n          He that is low no pride;\n         He that is humble ever shall\n          Have God to be his guide.\n\n        \"I am content with what I have,\n          Little be it or much;\n         And, Lord! contentment still I crave,\n          Because Thou savest such.\n\n        \"Fulness to them a burden is,\n          That go on pilgrimage;\n         Here little, and hereafter bliss,\n          Is best from age to age!\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 XXIII.\n\n                    AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION.\n\n\n            [Illustration: Popping in her head now and then]\n\nLike bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered about\nMr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, and\nlisten to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by\nkindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with the\nother three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then, \"to\npeek at the dear man,\" nothing seemed needed to complete their\nhappiness. But something _was_ needed, and the elder ones felt it,\nthough none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another\nwith an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg.
