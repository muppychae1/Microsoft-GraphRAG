As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for\nhis faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly\nremembered that Mr. March needed rest, and, seizing Laurie, he\nprecipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,\nwhich they did, by both sitting in one big chair, and talking hard.\n\nMr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the\nfine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage\nof it; how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most\nestimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just\nthere, and, after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,\nlooked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you\nto imagine; also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head, and asked,\nrather abruptly, if he wouldn't have something to eat. Jo saw and\nunderstood the look; and she stalked grimly away to get wine and\nbeef-tea, muttering to herself, as she slammed the door, \"I hate\nestimable young men with brown eyes!\"\n\nThere never _was_ such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat\nturkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned,\nand decorated; so was the plum-pudding, which quite melted in one's\nmouth; likewise the jellies, in which Amy revelled like a fly in a\nhoney-pot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,\n\"For my mind was that flustered, mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't\nroast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin'\nof it in a cloth.\"\n\nMr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke,--at whom\nJo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy-chairs\nstood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her\nfather, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank\nhealths, told stories, sung songs, \"reminisced,\" as the old folks say,\nand had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh-ride had been planned, but the\ngirls would not leave their father; so the guests departed early, and,\nas twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.\n\n\"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected\nto have. Do you remember?\" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had\nfollowed a long conversation about many things.\n\n\"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!\" said Meg, smiling at the fire,\nand congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.\n\n\"I think it's been a pretty hard one,\" observed Amy, watching the light\nshine on her ring, with thoughtful eyes.\n\n\"I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,\" whispered Beth, who\nsat on her father's knee.\n\n\"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially\nthe latter part of it. But you have got on bravely; and I think the\nburdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,\" said Mr. March,\nlooking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered\nround him.\n\n\"How do you know? Did mother tell you?\" asked Jo.\n\n\"Not much; straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several\ndiscoveries to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, tell us what they are!\" cried Meg, who sat beside him.\n\n\"Here is one;\" and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair,\nhe pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and two or\nthree little hard spots on the palm. \"I remember a time when this hand\nwas white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so. It was very\npretty then, but to me it is much prettier now,--for in these seeming\nblemishes I read a little history. A burnt-offering has been made of\nvanity; this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters;\nand I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long\ntime, so much good-will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value\nthe womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or\nfashionable accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good, industrious\nlittle hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away.\"\n\nIf Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it\nin the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he\ngave her.\n\n\"What about Jo? Please say something nice; for she has tried so hard,\nand been so very, very good to me,\" said Beth, in her father's ear.\n\nHe laughed, and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an\nunusually mild expression in her brown face.\n\n\"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a year\nago,\" said Mr. March. \"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HANNAH<|>PERSON<|>Hannah is a cook who forgot to put down the fat turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
