I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing\nMeg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the\nold gentleman collared me. Then I got angry, and bolted, for fear I\nshould forget myself.\"\n\n\"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know; so go down and make up. I'll\nhelp you.\"\n\n\"Hanged if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by every\none, just for a bit of a frolic. I _was_ sorry about Meg, and begged\npardon like a man; but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in the wrong.\"\n\n\"He didn't know that.\"\n\n\"He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It's no use, Jo;\nhe's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself, and don't need\nany one's apron-string to hold on by.\"\n\n\"What pepper-pots you are!\" sighed Jo. \"How do you mean to settle this\naffair?\"\n\n\"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't tell\nhim what the fuss's about.\"\n\n\"Bless you! he won't do that.\"\n\n\"I won't go down till he does.\"\n\n\"Now, Teddy, be sensible; let it pass, and I'll explain what I can. You\ncan't stay here, so what's the use of being melodramatic?\"\n\n\"I don't intend to stay here long, any way. I'll slip off and take a\njourney somewhere, and when grandpa misses me he'll come round fast\nenough.\"\n\n\"I dare say; but you ought not to go and worry him.\"\n\n\"Don't preach. I'll go to Washington and see Brooke; it's gay there, and\nI'll enjoy myself after the troubles.\"\n\n\"What fun you'd have! I wish I could run off too,\" said Jo, forgetting\nher part of Mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.\n\n\"Come on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and I'll stir\nup old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke; let's do it, Jo. We'll leave\na letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once. I've got money\nenough; it will do you good, and be no harm, as you go to your father.\"\n\nFor a moment Jo looked as if she would agree; for, wild as the plan was,\nit just suited her. She was tired of care and confinement, longed for\nchange, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel\ncharms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her eyes kindled as they\nturned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house\nopposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.\n\n\"If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time; but as\nI'm a miserable girl, I must be proper, and stop at home. Don't tempt\nme, Teddy, it's a crazy plan.\"\n\n\"That's the fun of it,\" began Laurie, who had got a wilful fit on him,\nand was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" cried Jo, covering her ears. \"'Prunes and prisms'\nare my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I came here to\nmoralize, not to hear about things that make me skip to think of.\"\n\n    [Illustration: \"Hold your tongue!\" cried Jo, covering her ears]\n\n\"I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had\nmore spirit,\" began Laurie insinuatingly.\n\n\"Bad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don't go making\nme add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will\nyou give up running away?\" asked Jo seriously.\n\n\"Yes, but you won't do it,\" answered Laurie, who wished \"to make up,\"\nbut felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.\n\n\"If I can manage the young one I can the old one,\" muttered Jo, as she\nwalked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map, with his head\npropped up on both hands.\n\n\"Come in!\" and Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as\nJo tapped at his door.\n\n\"It's only me, sir, come to return a book,\" she said blandly, as she\nentered.\n\n\"Want any more?\" asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but\ntrying not to show it.\n\n\"Yes, please. I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the second\nvolume,\" returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second\ndose of Boswell's \"Johnson,\" as he had recommended that lively work.\n\nThe shaggy eyebrows unbent a little, as he rolled the steps toward the\nshelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed. Jo skipped up, and,\nsitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was\nreally wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her\nvisit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her\nmind; for, after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced\nround on her, speaking so abruptly that \"Rasselas\" tumbled face downward\non the floor.\n\n\"What has that boy been about?
