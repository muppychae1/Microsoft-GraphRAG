He did like it, so don't scold, Jo,\" said Beth\nmeekly.\n\n\"You can't keep a secret. Never mind; it saves trouble now.\"\n\n\"Go on, please,\" said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work, looking\na trifle displeased.\n\n\"Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, we have\ntried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task, and worked at\nit with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,\nand we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle.\"\n\n\"Yes, I should think so;\" and Laurie thought regretfully of his own idle\ndays.\n\n\"Mother likes to have us out of doors as much as possible; so we bring\nour work here, and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring our\nthings in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,\nand play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the\n'Delectable Mountain,' for we can look far away and see the country\nwhere we hope to live some time.\"\n\nJo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine; for through an opening in the\nwood one could look across the wide, blue river, the meadows on the\nother side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills\nthat rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens plowed with\nthe splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and purple clouds lay on the\nhill-tops; and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white\npeaks, that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.\n\n\"How beautiful that is!\" said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see and\nfeel beauty of any kind.\n\n\"It's often so; and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but\nalways splendid,\" replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.\n\n\"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live some time,--the real\ncountry, she means, with pigs and chickens, and haymaking. It would be\nnice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could\never go to it,\" said Beth musingly.\n\n\"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we _shall_ go, by and\nby, when we are good enough,\" answered Meg, with her sweet voice.\n\n\"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do; I want to fly away at once, as\nthose swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.\"\n\n\"You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later; no fear of that,\" said Jo;\n\"I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and\nmaybe never get in after all.\"\n\n\"You'll have me for company, if that's any comfort. I shall have to do a\ndeal of travelling before I come in sight of your Celestial City. If I\narrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you, Beth?\"\n\nSomething in the boy's face troubled his little friend; but she said\ncheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, \"If people\nreally want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will get\nin; for I don't believe there are any locks on that door, or any guards\nat the gate. I always imagine it is as it is in the picture, where the\nshining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor Christian as he\ncomes up from the river.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could\ncome true, and we could live in them?\" said Jo, after a little pause.\n\n\"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd have,\"\nsaid Laurie, lying flat, and throwing cones at the squirrel who had\nbetrayed him.\n\n\"You'd have to take your favorite one. What is it?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?\"\n\n\"Yes, if the girls will too.\"\n\n\"We will. Now, Laurie.\"\n\n\"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle in\nGermany, and have just as much music as I choose. I'm to be a famous\nmusician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me; and I'm never\nto be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself, and live\nfor what I like. That's my favorite castle. What's yours, Meg?\"\n\nMargaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a brake\nbefore her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she said\nslowly, \"I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of luxurious\nthings,--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people,\nand heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like,\nwith plenty of servants, so I never need work a bit.
