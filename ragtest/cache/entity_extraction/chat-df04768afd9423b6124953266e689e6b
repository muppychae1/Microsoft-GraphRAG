Poor Jo, how she did glorify that\nplain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing\nescape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold\nsleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands!\n\n\"Dear old fellow! He couldn't have got himself up with more care if he'd\nbeen going a-wooing,\" said Jo to herself; and then a sudden thought,\nborn of the words, made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her\nball, and go down after it to hide her face.\n\nThe man≈ìuvre did not succeed as well as she expected, however; for,\nthough just in the act of setting fire to a funeral-pile, the Professor\ndropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the\nlittle blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,\nsaw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to\nresume their seats, wishing they had not left them.\n\nNobody knew where the evening went to; for Hannah skilfully abstracted\nthe babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.\nLaurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking\naway, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal\nmind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of\nbed, and Demi set his night-gown afire studying the structure of\nmatches, made a move to go.\n\n\"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together\nagain once more,\" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe and\npleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.\n\nThey were not _all_ there. But no one found the words thoughtless or\nuntrue; for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,\ninvisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the\nhousehold league that love made indissoluble. The little chair stood in\nits old place; the tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished\nwhen the needle grew \"so heavy,\" was still on its accustomed shelf; the\nbeloved instrument, seldom touched now, had not been moved; and above it\nBeth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon\nthem, seeming to say, \"Be happy. I am here.\"\n\n\"Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved,\" said\nLaurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.\n\nBut Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool,--\n\n\"Not to-night, dear. I can't show off to-night.\"\n\nBut she did show something better than brilliancy or skill; for she sung\nBeth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master\ncould not have taught, and touched the listeners' hearts with a sweeter\npower than any other inspiration could have given her. The room was very\nstill, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth's\nfavorite hymn. It was hard to say,--\n\n        \"Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;\"\n\nand Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that\nher welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.\n\n\"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song; for Mr. Bhaer sings that,\" said\nJo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with\na gratified \"Hem!\" as he stepped into the corner where Jo stood,\nsaying,--\n\n\"You will sing with me? We go excellently well together.\"\n\nA pleasing fiction, by the way; for Jo had no more idea of music than a\ngrasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a\nwhole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.\nIt didn't much matter; for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily\nand well; and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might listen\nto the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.\n\n                [Illustration: Mr. Bhaer sang heartily]\n\n        \"Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,\"\n\nused to be the Professor's favorite line, for \"das land\" meant Germany\nto him; but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,\nupon the words,--\n\n        \"There, oh there, might I with thee,\n         O my beloved, go!\"\n\nand one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she\nlonged to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither\nwhenever he liked.\n\nThe song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered\nwith laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners\nentirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet; for she had been\nintroduced simply as \"my sister,\" and no one had called her by her new\nname since he came. He forgot himself still further when Laurie said, in\nhis most gracious manner, at parting,--\n\n\"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that\nthere is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.\"\n\nThen the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly\nilluminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most\ndelightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\n\n\"I too shall go; but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me\nleave, dear madame, for a little business in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
