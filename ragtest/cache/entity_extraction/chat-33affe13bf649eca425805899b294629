No hint of this had reached the culprits,\nhowever, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before\nthe fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs.\nChester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter,\nsaid, in a bland tone, but with a cold look,--\n\n\"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about\nmy giving this table to any one but my girls. As this is the most\nprominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are\nthe chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take\nthis place. I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in\nthe cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have\nanother table if you like.\"\n\nMrs. Chester had fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver\nthis little speech; but when the time came, she found it rather\ndifficult to utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking\nstraight at her, full of surprise and trouble.\n\nAmy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess what,\nand said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,--\n\n\"Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?\"\n\n\"Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg; it's merely a matter\nof expediency, you see; my girls will naturally take the lead, and this\ntable is considered their proper place. _I_ think it very appropriate\nto you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty;\nbut we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that\nyou have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't you like the flower-table? The\nlittle girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. You could make a\ncharming thing of it, and the flower-table is always attractive, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Especially to gentlemen,\" added May, with a look which enlightened Amy\nas to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. She colored angrily, but\ntook no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered, with\nunexpected amiability,--\n\n\"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I'll give up my place here at\nonce, and attend to the flowers, if you like.\"\n\n\"You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,\" began\nMay, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty\nracks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so carefully\nmade and so gracefully arranged. She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook\nher meaning, and said quickly,--\n\n\"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way;\" and sweeping her contributions\ninto her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her\nworks of art had been insulted past forgiveness.\n\n\"Now she's mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak, mamma,\"\nsaid May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.\n\n\"Girls' quarrels are soon over,\" returned her mother, feeling a trifle\nashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.\n\nThe little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which\ncordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell to\nwork, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. But\neverything seemed against her: it was late, and she was tired; every one\nwas too busy with their own affairs to help her; and the little girls\nwere only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many\nmagpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to\npreserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm\nafter she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her\nhead when the hanging baskets were filled; her best tile got a splash of\nwater, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's cheek; she bruised her\nhands with hammering, and got cold working in a draught, which last\naffliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl-reader\nwho has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy, and\nwish her well through with her task.\n\nThere was great indignation at home when she told her story that\nevening. Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done\nright; Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all; and Jo demanded\nwhy she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to\nget on without her.\n\n\"Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such things,\nand though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to show it.\nThey will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions, won't\nthey, Marmee?\"\n\n\"That's the right spirit, my dear; a kiss for a blow is always best,\nthough it's not very easy to give it sometimes,\" said her mother, with\nthe air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and\npractising.\n\nIn spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,\nAmy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her\nenemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came\nto her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
