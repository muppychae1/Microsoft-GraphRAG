Amy\nwas ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off danger,\nshe departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.\n\nAunt March received them with her usual hospitality.\n\n\"What do you want now?\" she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles,\nwhile the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out,--\n\n                 [Illustration: What do you want now?]\n\n\"Go away. No boys allowed here.\"\n\nLaurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.\n\n\"No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among\npoor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn't sick,\nwhich I've no doubt she will be,--looks like it now. Don't cry, child,\nit worries me to hear people sniff.\"\n\nAmy _was_ on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's\ntail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak, and call out,--\n\n\"Bless my boots!\" in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.\n\n\"What do you hear from your mother?\" asked the old lady gruffly.\n\n\"Father is much better,\" replied Jo, trying to keep sober.\n\n\"Oh, is he? Well, that won't last long, I fancy; March never had any\nstamina,\" was the cheerful reply.\n\n\"Ha, ha! never say die, take a pinch of snuff, good by, good by!\"\nsqualled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap\nas Laurie tweaked him in the rear.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! and, Jo, you'd better go\nat once; it isn't proper to be gadding about so late with a rattle-pated\nboy like--\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!\" cried Polly, tumbling\noff the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the \"rattle-pated\" boy,\nwho was shaking with laughter at the last speech.\n\n\"I don't think I _can_ bear it, but I'll try,\" thought Amy, as she was\nleft alone with Aunt March.\n\n\"Get along, you fright!\" screamed Polly; and at that rude speech Amy\ncould not restrain a sniff.\n\n\n\n\n                                 XVIII.\n\n                               DARK DAYS.\n\n\n                [Illustration: Beth did have the fever]\n\nBeth did have the fever, and was much sicker than any one but Hannah and\nthe doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.\nLaurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything all her\nown way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the\nexcellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,\nand kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote\nletters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness. She could not\nthink it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind\nHannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of \"Mrs. March bein' told, and worried\njust for sech a trifle.\" Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night; not a\nhard task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly\nas long as she could control herself. But there came a time when during\nthe fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on\nthe coverlet, as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a\nthroat so swollen that there was no music left; a time when she did not\nknow the familiar faces round her, but addressed them by wrong names,\nand called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg\nbegged to be allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she \"would\nthink of it, though there was no danger _yet_.\" A letter from Washington\nadded to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not\nthink of coming home for a long while.\n\nHow dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how\nheavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while\nthe shadow of death hovered over the once happy home! Then it was that\nMargaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how\nrich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could\nbuy,--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of\nlife. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that\nsuffering little sister always before her eyes, and that pathetic voice\nsounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of\nBeth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all\nhearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's un\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
