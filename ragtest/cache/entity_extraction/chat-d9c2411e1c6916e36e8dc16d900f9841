We've\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\nthat. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want\nto buy Undine and Sintram for myself; I've wanted it _so_ long,\" said\nJo, who was a bookworm.\n\n\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\nwhich no one heard but the hearth-brush and kettle-holder.\n\n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing-pencils; I really need them,\"\nsaid Amy decidedly.\n\n\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\ngive up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun;\nI'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the heels\nof her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\n\n\"I know _I_ do,--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when\nI'm longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\nagain.\n\n\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\nfly out of the window or cry?\"\n\n\"It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\ntidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get\nso stiff, I can't practise well at all;\" and Beth looked at her rough\nhands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\n\n\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy; \"for you don't\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't\nknow your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if\nhe isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\n\n\"If you mean _libel_, I'd say so, and not talk about _labels_, as if\npapa was a pickle-bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\n\n\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be _statirical_ about it. It's\nproper to use good words, and improve your _vocabilary_,\" returned Amy,\nwith dignity.\n\n\"Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money\npapa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we'd be,\nif we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\n\n\"You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than the\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\nspite of their money.\"\n\n\"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work,\nwe make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\n\n\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\nthe long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her\nhands in her pockets, and began to whistle.\n\n\"Don't, Jo; it's so boyish!\"\n\n\"That's why I do it.\"\n\n\"I detest rude, unlady-like girls!\"\n\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\n\n\"'Birds in their little nests agree,'\" sang Beth, the peace-maker, with\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\n\"pecking\" ended for that time.\n\n\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so much\nwhen you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your\nhair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\n\n\"I'm not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two\ntails till I'm twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\na chestnut mane. \"I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss\nMarch, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster! It's bad\nenough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and\nmanners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it's\nworse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with papa, and I can\nonly stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!\" And Jo shook the\nblue army-sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball\nbounded across the room.\n\n\"Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped; so you must try to be\ncontented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\ngirls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that\nall the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in\nits touch.\n\n\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular and\nprim.
