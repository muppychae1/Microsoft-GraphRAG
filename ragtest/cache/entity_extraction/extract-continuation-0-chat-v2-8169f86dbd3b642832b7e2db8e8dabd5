The hard, bitter\nfeeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of\nflowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were\nexclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.\n\n\"It's for Belle, of course; George always sends her some, but these are\naltogether ravishing,\" cried Annie, with a great sniff.\n\n\"They are for Miss March, the man said. And here's a note,\" put in the\nmaid, holding it to Meg.\n\n\"What fun! Who are they from? Didn't know you had a lover,\" cried the\ngirls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.\n\n\"The note is from mother, and the flowers from Laurie,\" said Meg simply,\nyet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Annie, with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note\ninto her pocket, as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false\npride; for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers\ncheered her up by their beauty.\n\nFeeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for\nherself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the\nbreasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that\nClara, the elder sister, told her she was \"the sweetest little thing she\never saw;\" and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.\nSomehow the kind act finished her despondency; and when all the rest\nwent to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed\nface in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair, and\nfastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so _very_\nshabby now.\n\nShe enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her\nheart's content; every one was very kind, and she had three compliments.\nAnnie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice;\nMajor Lincoln asked who \"the fresh little girl, with the beautiful\neyes,\" was; and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her, because she\n\"didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her,\" as he gracefully expressed\nit. So, altogether, she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit\nof a conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just\ninside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice,\nwhen she heard a voice ask, on the other side of the flowery wall,--\n\n\"How old is he?\"\n\n\"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,\" replied another voice.\n\n\"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it? Sallie\nsays they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.\"\n\n\"Mrs M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,\nearly as it is. The girl evidently doesn't think of it yet,\" said Mrs.\nMoffat.\n\n\"She told that fib about her mamma, as if she did know, and colored up\nwhen the flowers came, quite prettily. Poor thing! she'd be so nice if\nshe was only got up in style. Do you think she'd be offended if we\noffered to lend her a dress for Thursday?\" asked another voice.\n\n\"She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy tarlatan is\nall she has got. She may tear it to-night, and that will be a good\nexcuse for offering a decent one.\"\n\n\"We'll see. I shall ask young Laurence, as a compliment to her, and\nwe'll have fun about it afterward.\"\n\n                 [Illustration: Meg's partner appeared]\n\nHere Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and rather\nagitated. She _was_ proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it\nhelped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had\njust heard; for, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not\nhelp understanding the gossip of her friends. She tried to forget it,\nbut could not, and kept repeating to herself, \"Mrs. M. has made her\nplans,\" \"that fib about her mamma,\" and \"dowdy tarlatan,\" till she was\nready to cry, and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As\nthat was impossible, she did her best to seem gay; and, being rather\nexcited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she\nwas making. She was very glad when it was all over, and she was quiet in\nher bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached\nand her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish,\nyet well-meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed\nthe peace of the old one, in which, till now, she had lived as happily\nas a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoilt by the silly\nspeeches she had over\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SALLIE<|>PERSON<|>Sallie offered to dress Meg's hair)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNIE<|>PERSON<|>Annie offered to tie Meg's sash)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLE<|>PERSON<|>Belle praised Meg's white arms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg felt heavy-hearted due to perceived pity for her poverty)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE<|>PERSON<|>George sent flowers to Belle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie sent flowers to Meg)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLARA<|>PERSON<|>Clara complimented Meg's attention to detail)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAJOR LINCOLN<|>PERSON<|>Major Lincoln complimented Meg's beautiful eyes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
