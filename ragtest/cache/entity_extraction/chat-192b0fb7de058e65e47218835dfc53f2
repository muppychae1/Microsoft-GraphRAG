He saw the trouble in her face, and\ndrew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, \"Where have you been\ncalling, all so fine?\"\n\n\"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle\nMoffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend the\nwinter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must be!\"\n\n\"Do you envy her, Meg?\" said Laurie.\n\n\"I'm afraid I do.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it!\" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Meg, looking surprised.\n\n\"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a\npoor man,\" said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to\nmind what she said.\n\n\"I shall never '_go_ and marry' any one,\" observed Meg, walking on with\ngreat dignity, while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping\nstones, and \"behaving like children,\" as Meg said to herself, though she\nmight have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress\non.\n\nFor a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite\nbewildered. She rushed to the door when the postman rang; was rude to\nMr. Brooke whenever they met; would sit looking at Meg with a woe-begone\nface, occasionally jumping up to shake, and then to kiss her, in a very\nmysterious manner; Laurie and she were always making signs to one\nanother, and talking about \"Spread Eagles,\" till the girls declared they\nhad both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the\nwindow, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the\nsight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden, and finally capturing\nher in Amy's bower. What went on there, Meg could not see; but shrieks\nof laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a great\nflapping of newspapers.\n\n\"What shall we do with that girl? She never _will_ behave like a young\nlady,\" sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.\n\n\"I hope she won't; she is so funny and dear as she is,\" said Beth, who\nhad never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets\nwith any one but her.\n\n\"It's very trying, but we never can make her _commy la fo_,\" added Amy,\nwho sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a\nvery becoming way,--two agreeable things, which made her feel unusually\nelegant and ladylike.\n\nIn a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected\nto read.\n\n    [Illustration: Jo laid herself on the sofa and affected to read]\n\n\"Have you anything interesting there?\" asked Meg, with condescension.\n\n\"Nothing but a story; won't amount to much, I guess,\" returned Jo,\ncarefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.\n\n\"You'd better read it aloud; that will amuse us and keep you out of\nmischief,\" said Amy, in her most grown-up tone.\n\n\"What's the name?\" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind the\nsheet.\n\n\"The Rival Painters.\"\n\n\"That sounds well; read it,\" said Meg.\n\nWith a loud \"Hem!\" and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast. The\ngirls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat\npathetic, as most of the characters died in the end.\n\n\"I like that about the splendid picture,\" was Amy's approving remark, as\nJo paused.\n\n\"I prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite\nnames; isn't that queer?\" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the \"lovering\npart\" was tragical.\n\n\"Who wrote it?\" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's face.\n\nThe reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed\ncountenance, and, with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement,\nreplied in a loud voice, \"Your sister.\"\n\n\"You?\" cried Meg, dropping her work.\n\n\"It's very good,\" said Amy critically.\n\n\"I knew it! I knew it! O my Jo, I _am_ so proud!\" and Beth ran to hug\nher sister, and exult over this splendid success.\n\nDear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! how Meg wouldn't\nbelieve it till she saw the words, \"Miss Josephine March,\" actually\nprinted in the paper; how graciously Amy criticised the artistic parts\nof the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately\ncouldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead; how Beth got\nexcited, and skipped and sung with joy; how Hannah came in to exclaim\n\"Sakes alive, well I never!\" in great astonishment at \"that Jo's\ndoin's;\" how proud Mrs. March was when she knew it; how Jo laughed, with\ntears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a peacock and\ndone with it; and how the \"Spread Eagle\" might be said to flap his wings\ntriumphantly over the House of March, as the paper passed from hand to\nhand.\n\n\"Tell us all about it.\" \"When did it come?\" \"How much did you get for\nit?\" \"What _will_ father say?\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
