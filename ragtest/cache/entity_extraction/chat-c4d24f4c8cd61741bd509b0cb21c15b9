As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in\none of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this\nroom there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes, with which\nEsther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to array\nherself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long\nmirror, making stately courtesies, and sweeping her train about, with a\nrustle which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she\ndid not hear Laurie's ring, nor see his face peeping in at her, as she\ngravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on\nwhich she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue\nbrocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk\ncarefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo\nafterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay\nsuit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as\nwell as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, \"Ain't\nwe fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha!\nha!\"\n\n             [Illustration: Gravely promenaded to and fro]\n\nHaving with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it\nshould offend her majesty, Laurie tapped, and was graciously received.\n\n\"Sit down and rest while I put these things away; then I want to consult\nyou about a very serious matter,\" said Amy, when she had shown her\nsplendor, and driven Polly into a corner. \"That bird is the trial of my\nlife,\" she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while\nLaurie seated himself astride of a chair. \"Yesterday, when aunt was\nasleep, and I was trying to be as still as a mouse, Polly began to\nsquall and flap about in his cage; so I went to let him out, and found a\nbig spider there. I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase; Polly\nmarched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the bookcase,\nsaying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, 'Come out and take a\nwalk, my dear.' I _couldn't_ help laughing, which made Poll swear, and\naunt woke up and scolded us both.\"\n\n\"Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?\" asked Laurie,\nyawning.\n\n\"Yes; out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and\nscrambled up on aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! catch her! catch\nher!' as I chased the spider.\n\n\"That's a lie! Oh lor!\" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.\n\n\"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,\" cried Laurie,\nshaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side, and gravely\ncroaked, \"Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!\"\n\n\"Now I'm ready,\" said Amy, shutting the wardrobe, and taking a paper out\nof her pocket. \"I want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is\nlegal and right. I felt that I ought to do it, for life is uncertain and\nI don't want any ill-feeling over my tomb.\"\n\n                       [Illustration: Amy's Will]\n\nLaurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read\nthe following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the\nspelling:--\n\n    \"MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT.\n\n    \"I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, do give and\n    bequeethe all my earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely\n\n    \"To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of\n    art, including frames.

And I herewith also\n    leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.\n\n    \"To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my\n    paper marshay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did\n    say it hadn't any neck.
