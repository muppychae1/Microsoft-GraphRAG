I felt as if I'd got\n    into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling\n    through the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band\n    below, and waiting for my lover, like a real story-book girl. I\n    had a feeling that something was going to happen, and I was\n    ready for it. I didn't feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool,\n    and only a little excited.\n\n[Illustration: Trying to sketch the gray-stone lion's head on the wall]\n\n    \"By and by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying\n    through the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled that I\n    forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He said\n    he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was\n    very ill; so he was going at once, in the night train, and only\n    had time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and\n    disappointed for myself, but only for a minute, because he\n    said, as he shook hands,--and said it in a way that I could not\n    mistake,--'I shall soon come back; you won't forget me, Amy?'\n\n    \"I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied,\n    and there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes,\n    for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know\n    he wanted to speak, but I think, from something he once hinted,\n    that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort\n    yet awhile, for he is a rash boy, and the old gentleman dreads a\n    foreign daughter-in-law. We shall soon meet in Rome; and then,\n    if I don't change my mind, I'll say 'Yes, thank you,' when he\n    says 'Will you, please?'\n\n    \"Of course this is all _very private_, but I wished you to know\n    what was going on. Don't be anxious about me; remember I am your\n    'prudent Amy,' and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as\n    much advice as you like; I'll use it if I can. I wish I could\n    see you for a good talk, Marmee.

I'm sure\nthere is something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so, mother?\"\n\n\"She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father as much as\nshe used. I found her crying over the babies the other day. When she\nsings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in\nher face that I don't understand. This isn't like Beth, and it worries\nme.\"\n\n\"Have you asked her about it?\"\n\n\"I have tried once or twice; but she either evaded my questions, or\nlooked so distressed that I stopped. I never force my children's\nconfidence, and I seldom have to wait for it long.\"\n\nMrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed\nquite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's; and, after\nsewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said,--\n\n\"I think she is growing up, and so begins to dream dreams, and have\nhopes and fears and fidgets, without knowing why, or being able to\nexplain them. Why, mother, Beth's eighteen, but we don't realize it, and\ntreat her like a child, forgetting she's a woman.\"\n\n\"So she is. Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,\" returned her mother,\nwith a sigh and a smile.\n\n\"Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of\nworries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by one. I promise\nnever to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you.\"\n\n\"It is a great comfort, Jo; I always feel strong when you are at home,\nnow Meg is gone. Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon;\nbut when the tug comes, you are always ready.\"\n\n\"Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there must always be one\nscrub in a family. Amy is splendid in fine works, and I'm not; but I\nfeel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up, or half the\nfamily fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing herself abroad; but if\nanything is amiss at home, I'm your man.\"\n\n\"I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender little\nheart to her Jo sooner than to any one else. Be very kind, and don't let\nher think any one watches or talks about her. If she only would get\nquite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn't have a wish in the world.\"\n\n\"Happy woman! I've got heaps.\"\n\n\"My dear, what are they?\"\n\n\"I'll settle Bethy's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine.
