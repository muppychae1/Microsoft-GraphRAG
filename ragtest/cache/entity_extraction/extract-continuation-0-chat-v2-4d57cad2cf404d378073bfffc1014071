At first, every one was eager\nto write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter-box\nby one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their\nWashington correspondence. As one of these packets contained\ncharacteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and\nread them:--\n\n    \"MY DEAREST MOTHER,--\n\n    \"It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made\n    us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and\n    crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate\n    that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long,\n    since he is so useful to you and father. The girls are all as\n    good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing\n    all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if\n    I didn't know that her 'moral fit' wouldn't last long. Beth is\n    as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what\n    you told her. She grieves about father, and looks sober except\n    when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I\n    take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am\n    teaching her to make button-holes and mend her stockings. She\n    tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her\n    improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a\n    motherly old hen, as Jo says; and Laurie is very kind and\n    neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue\n    sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah\n    is a perfect saint; she does not scold at all, and always calls\n    me Miss 'Margaret,' which is quite proper, you know, and treats\n    me with respect. We are all well and busy; but we long, day\n    and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to father,\n    and believe me, ever your own\n                                                              \"MEG.\"\n\nThis note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to\nthe next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper,\nornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed\nletters:--\n\n    \"MY PRECIOUS MARMEE,--\n\n    \"Three cheers for dear father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph\n    right off, and let us know the minute he was better. I rushed\n    up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank God for\n    being so good to us; but I could only cry, and say, 'I'm glad!\n    I'm glad!' Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer? for I\n    felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times; and\n    now I can enjoy them, for every one is so desperately good,\n    it's like living in a nest of turtle-doves. You'd laugh to see\n    Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier\n    every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes. The children are\n    regular archangels, and I--well, I'm Jo, and never shall be\n    anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a\n    quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little\n    thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I\n    ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again till\n    I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't, and got mad. It lasted\n    all day; I felt bad, and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are\n    both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon; but I thought he'd come\n    to it, for I _was_ in the right. He didn't come; and just at\n    night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river.\n    I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun\n    set on _my_ anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I\n    met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both\n    laughed, begged each other's pardon, and felt all good and\n    comfortable again.\n\n    \"I made a 'pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash; and,\n    as father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse\n    him. Give him the lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself\n    a dozen times for your\n                                                   \"TOPSY-TURVY JO.\"\n\n                         \"A SONG FROM THE SUDS.\n\n        \"Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,\n           While the white foam rises high;\n         And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,\n           And fasten the clothes to dry;\n         Then out in the free fresh air they swing,\n           Under the sunny sky.\n\n        \"I wish we could wash from our hearts and souls\n           The stains of the week away,\n         And let water and air by their magic make\n           Ourselves as pure as they;\n         Then on the earth there would be indeed\n           A glorious washing-day!\n\n        \"Along the path of a useful life,\n           Will heart's-ease ever bloom\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is the head of the family and reads despatches, happy news from Washington)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
