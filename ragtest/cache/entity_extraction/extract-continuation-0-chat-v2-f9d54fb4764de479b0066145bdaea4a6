Something in his face made Amy say quickly and\nwarmly,--\n\n\"No; be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd\nrather have a hearty English hand-shake than all the sentimental\nsalutations in France.\"\n\n\"Good-by, dear,\" and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,\nLaurie left her, after a hand-shake almost painful in its heartiness.\n\nNext morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made\nher smile at the beginning and sigh at the end:--\n\n    \"MY DEAR MENTOR,--\n\n    \"Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself,\n    for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of\n    boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a\n    blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited\n    by a rouser. Tell him so, with my congratulations.\n\n                            \"Yours gratefully,          TELEMACHUS.\"\n\n\"Good boy! I'm glad he's gone,\" said Amy, with an approving smile; the\nnext minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding,\nwith an involuntary sigh,--\n\n\"Yes, I _am_ glad, but how I shall miss him!\"\n\n\n\n\n                [Illustration: The Valley of the Shadow]\n\n                                  XL.\n\n                       THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW.\n\n\nWhen the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,\nand tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased\naffection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of\ntrouble. They put away their grief, and each did his or her part toward\nmaking that last year a happy one.\n\nThe pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was\ngathered everything that she most loved,--flowers, pictures, her piano,\nthe little work-table, and the beloved pussies. Father's best books\nfound their way there, mother's easy-chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest\nsketches; and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,\nto make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly set apart a little sum,\nthat he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with\nthe fruit she loved and longed for; old Hannah never wearied of\nconcocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears\nas she worked; and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful\nletters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands\nthat know no winter.\n\nHere, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, tranquil\nand busy as ever; for nothing could change the sweet, unselfish nature,\nand even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make it happier for\nthose who should remain behind. The feeble fingers were never idle, and\none of her pleasures was to make little things for the school-children\ndaily passing to and fro,--to drop a pair of mittens from her window for\na pair of purple hands, a needle-book for some small mother of many\ndolls, pen-wipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pot-hooks,\nscrap-books for picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices,\ntill the reluctant climbers up the ladder of learning found their way\nstrewn with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as\na sort of fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts\nmiraculously suited to their tastes and needs. If Beth had wanted any\nreward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her\nwindow, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters which came to\nher, full of blots and gratitude.\n\nThe first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look\nround, and say \"How beautiful this is!\" as they all sat together in her\nsunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and\nsisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from\nthe wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as\napplicable now as when written centuries ago; a little chapel, where a\npaternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying\nto show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation\npossible. Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of those who\nlistened; for the father's heart was in the minister's religion, and the\nfrequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he\nspoke or read.\n\nIt was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as\npreparation for the sad hours to come; for, by and by, Beth said the\nneedle was \"so heavy,\" and put it down forever; talking wearied her,\nfaces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil\nspirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble\nflesh. Ah me! such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching\nhearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced\nto see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the\nbitter cry, \"Help me, help me!\" and to feel that there was no help.
