What do you mean?\" and Meg looked sober.\n\n\"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay them, you\nknow, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged\nat the shop.\"\n\n\"Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking\nbits of rubber to make balls;\" and Meg tried to keep her countenance,\nAmy looked so grave and important.\n\n\"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to\nbe thought mean, you must do it, too. It's nothing but limes now, for\nevery one is sucking them in their desks in school-time, and trading\nthem off for pencils, bead-rings, paper dolls, or something else, at\nrecess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime; if she's mad\nwith her, she eats one before her face, and don't offer even a suck.\nThey treat by turns; and I've had ever so many, but haven't returned\nthem; and I ought, for they are debts of honor, you know.\"\n\n\"How much will pay them off, and restore your credit?\" asked Meg, taking\nout her purse.\n\n\"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat\nfor you. Don't you like limes?\"\n\n\"Not much; you may have my share. Here's the money. Make it last as long\nas you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket-money! I'll have a\ngrand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate\nabout taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm actually suffering\nfor one.\"\n\nNext day Amy was rather late at school; but could not resist the\ntemptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper\nparcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.\nDuring the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four\ndelicious limes (she ate one on the way), and was going to treat,\ncirculated through her \"set,\" and the attentions of her friends became\nquite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the\nspot; Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess; and\nJenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her\nlimeless state, promptly buried the hatchet, and offered to furnish\nanswers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow's\ncutting remarks about \"some persons whose noses were not too flat to\nsmell other people's limes, and stuck-up people, who were not too proud\nto ask for them;\" and she instantly crushed \"that Snow girl's\" hopes by\nthe withering telegram, \"You needn't be so polite all of a sudden, for\nyou won't get any.\"\n\nA distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and\nAmy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her foe\nrankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume the\nairs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! pride goes before a\nfall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success.\nNo sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments, and bowed\nhimself out, than Jenny, under pretence of asking an important question,\ninformed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her\ndesk.\n\nNow Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly\nvowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the\nlaw. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing-gum after\na long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and\nnewspapers, had suppressed a private post-office, had forbidden\ndistortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that\none man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys\nare trying enough to human patience, goodness knows! but girls are\ninfinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen, with tyrannical\ntempers, and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis\nknew any quantity of Greek, Latin, Algebra, and ologies of all sorts, so\nhe was called a fine teacher; and manners, morals, feelings, and\nexamples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most\nunfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had\nevidently taken his coffee too strong that morning; there was an east\nwind, which always affected his neuralgia; and his pupils had not done\nhim the credit which he felt he deserved: therefore, to use the\nexpressive, if not elegant, language of a school-girl,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
