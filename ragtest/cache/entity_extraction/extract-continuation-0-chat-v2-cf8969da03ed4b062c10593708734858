Turning as from a\nfallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her\nromantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated between two decanters\nwith the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with\none of the Madame de Staëls of the age, who looked daggers at another\nCorinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after out-manœuvring her in\nefforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea Johnsonianly\nand appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech\nimpossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting their mollusks and\nglacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting themselves to\noysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young musician, who was\ncharming the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen\nof the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of\nthe party.\n\nBefore the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely _désillusionée_,\nthat she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined\nher, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the\nphilosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an\nintellectual tournament in the recess. The conversation was miles beyond\nJo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were\nunknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms; and the\nonly thing \"evolved from her inner consciousness,\" was a bad headache\nafter it was all over. It dawned upon her gradually that the world was\nbeing picked to pieces, and put together on new, and, according to the\ntalkers, on infinitely better principles than before; that religion was\nin a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be\nthe only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any\nsort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came\nover her, as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time\nand space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.\n\nShe looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him\nlooking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.\nHe shook his head, and beckoned her to come away; but she was\nfascinated, just then, by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and\nkept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to\nrely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs.\n\nNow, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man, and slow to offer his own opinions,\nnot because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be\nlightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,\nattracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his\nbrows, and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul\nwould be led astray by the rockets, to find, when the display was over,\nthat they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.\n\nHe bore it as long as he could; but when he was appealed to for an\nopinion, he blazed up with honest indignation, and defended religion\nwith all the eloquence of truth,--an eloquence which made his broken\nEnglish musical, and his plain face beautiful. He had a hard fight, for\nthe wise men argued well; but he didn't know when he was beaten, and\nstood to his colors like a man. Somehow, as he talked, the world got\nright again to Jo; the old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed\nbetter than the new; God was not a blind force, and immortality was not\na pretty fable, but a blessed fact. She felt as if she had solid ground\nunder her feet again; and when Mr. Bhaer paused, out-talked, but not one\nwhit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.\n\nShe did neither; but she remembered this scene, and gave the Professor\nher heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out\nthen and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent. She\nbegan to see that character is a better possession than money, rank,\nintellect, or beauty; and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man\nhas defined it to be, \"truth, reverence, and good-will,\" then her friend\nFriedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.\n\nThis belief strengthened daily. She valued his esteem, she coveted his\nrespect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship; and, just when the\nwish was sincerest, she came near losing everything. It all grew out of\na cocked hat; for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her\nlesson, with a paper soldier-cap on his head, which Tina had put there,\nand he had forgotten to take off.\n\n\"It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down,\" thought\nJo, with a smile, as he said \"Goot efening,\" and sat soberly down, quite\nunconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his\nhead-gear, for he was going to read her the \"Death of Wallenstein.\"\n\n      [Illustration: He doesn't prink at his glass before coming]\n\nShe said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,\nhearty laugh, when anything\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a young woman attending a social event with intellectuals and philosophers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
