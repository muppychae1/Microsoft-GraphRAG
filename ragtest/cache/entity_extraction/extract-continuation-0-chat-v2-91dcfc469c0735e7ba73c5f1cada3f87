She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering,\nafter her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was her\nespecial dread; but, thanks to the new manager, he behaved with\npraiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer \"a capital old fellow\" in\npublic, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo's improved\nappearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor's\nhat on the Marches' hall-table nearly every evening. But he exulted in\nprivate and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of\nplate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate\ncoat-of-arms.\n\nFor a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like regularity;\nthen he stayed away for three whole days, and made no sign,--a\nproceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to become\npensive, at first, and then--alas for romance!--very cross.\n\n\"Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It's\nnothing to me, of course; but I _should_ think he would have come and\nbid us good-by, like a gentleman,\" she said to herself, with a\ndespairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary\nwalk, one dull afternoon.\n\n\"You'd better take the little umbrella, dear; it looks like rain,\" said\nher mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not alluding\nto the fact.\n\n\"Yes, Marmee; do you want anything in town? I've got to run in and get\nsome paper,\" returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the\nglass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.\n\n\"Yes; I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and\ntwo yards of narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your thick boots on,\nand something warm under your cloak?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" answered Jo absently.\n\n\"If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long to\nsee the dear man,\" added Mrs. March.\n\nJo heard _that_, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk\nrapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her\nheartache,--\n\n\"How good she is to me! What _do_ girls do who haven't any mothers to\nhelp them through their troubles?\"\n\nThe dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks, and\nwholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate; but Jo found\nherself in that part of the city before she did a single errand,\nloitering along as if waiting for some one, examining engineering\ninstruments in one window and samples of wool in another with most\nunfeminine interest; tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered by\ndescending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as\nif they wondered \"how the deuce she got there.\" A drop of rain on her\ncheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons; for\nthe drops continued to fall, and, being a woman as well as a lover, she\nfelt that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her\nbonnet. Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had forgotten\nto take in her hurry to be off; but regret was unavailing, and nothing\ncould be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching. She looked up at\nthe lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked with black,\nforward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering look behind, at\na certain grimy warehouse, with \"Hoffmann, Swartz, & Co.\" over the door,\nand said to herself, with a sternly reproachful air,--\n\n\"It serves me right! What business had I to put on all my best things\nand come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor? Jo, I'm\nashamed of you! No, you shall _not_ go there to borrow an umbrella, or\nfind out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do\nyour errands in the rain; and if you catch your death and ruin your\nbonnet, it's no more than you deserve. Now then!\"\n\nWith that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly\nescaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself into\nthe arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, \"I beg pardon, ma'am,\"\nand looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted herself,\nspread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and, putting\ntemptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the\nankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. The fact that a\nsomewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected\nbonnet, attracted her attention; and, looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer\nlooking down.\n\n              [Illustration: Looking up she saw Mr. Bhaer]\n\n\"I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many\nhorse-noses, and so fast through much mud.
