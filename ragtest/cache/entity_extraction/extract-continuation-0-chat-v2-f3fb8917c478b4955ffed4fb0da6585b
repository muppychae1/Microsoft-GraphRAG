Meg\ncould walk in the conservatory whenever she liked, and revel in\nbouquets; Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the\nold gentleman with her criticisms; Amy copied pictures, and enjoyed\nbeauty to her heart's content; and Laurie played \"lord of the manor\" in\nthe most delightful style.\n\nBut Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up\ncourage to go to the \"Mansion of Bliss,\" as Meg called it. She went once\nwith Jo; but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared\nat her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \"Hey!\" so loud,\nthat he frightened her so much her \"feet chattered on the floor,\" she\ntold her mother; and she ran away, declaring she would never go there\nany more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements\ncould overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in\nsome mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the\nbrief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and\ntalked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had\nheard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to\nstay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if\nfascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped, and stood listening,\nwith her great eyes wide open, and her cheeks red with the excitement of\nthis unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had\nbeen a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's lessons and teachers;\nand presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs.\nMarch,--\n\n\"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting\ntoo fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn't some of\nyour girls like to run over, and practise on it now and then, just to\nkeep it in tune, you know, ma'am?\"\n\nBeth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep\nfrom clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation; and the\nthought of practising on that splendid instrument quite took her breath\naway. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd\nlittle nod and smile,--\n\n\"They needn't see or speak to any one, but run in at any time; for I'm\nshut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great\ndeal, and the servants are never near the drawing-room after nine\no'clock.\"\n\nHere he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that\nlast arrangement left nothing to be desired. \"Please tell the young\nladies what I say; and if they don't care to come, why, never mind.\"\nHere a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a\nface full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way,--\n\n\"O sir, they do care, very, very much!\"\n\n             [Illustration: O sir, they do care very much]\n\n\"Are you the musical girl?\" he asked, without any startling \"Hey!\" as he\nlooked down at her very kindly.\n\n\"I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure nobody\nwill hear me--and be disturbed,\" she added, fearing to be rude, and\ntrembling at her own boldness as she spoke.\n\n\"Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day; so come, and drum\naway as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\"\n\n\"How kind you are, sir!\"\n\nBeth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore; but she was\nnot frightened now, and gave the big hand a grateful squeeze, because\nshe had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her.\nThe old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and,\nstooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard,--\n\n\"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my dear!\nGood day, madam;\" and away he went, in a great hurry.\n\nBeth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the\nglorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not at home.\nHow blithely she sung that evening, and how they all laughed at her,\nbecause she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in\nher sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of\nthe house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the\nside-door, and made her way, as noiselessly as any mouse, to the\ndrawing-room, where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some\npretty, easy music lay on the piano; and, with trembling fingers, and\nfrequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great\ninstrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything\nelse but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was\nlike the voice of a beloved friend.\n\nShe stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner; but she had no\nappetite, and could only sit and smile upon every one in a general\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a person who enjoys pleasant evenings and parties at the great house)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a person who browses over the new library voraciously)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a person who copies pictures and enjoys beauty)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a person who plays \"lord of the manor\" in a delightful style)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is a person who yearns for the grand piano)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
