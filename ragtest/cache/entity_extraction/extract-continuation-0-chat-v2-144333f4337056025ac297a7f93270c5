She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came\nto her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table\nthat morning, while the little girls were in an ante-room filling the\nbaskets, she took up her pet production,--a little book, the antique\ncover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which,\non leaves of vellum, she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As\nshe turned the pages, rich in dainty devices, with very pardonable\npride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed\nin a brilliant scroll-work of scarlet, blue, and gold, with little\nspirits of good-will helping one another up and down among the thorns\nand flowers, were the words, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\n\n\"I ought, but I don't,\" thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright\npage to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not\nhide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. Amy stood a minute,\nturning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for\nall heart-burnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true\nsermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street,\nschool, office, or home; even a fair-table may become a pulpit, if it\ncan offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season.\nAmy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and\nthere; and she did what many of us do not always do,--took the sermon to\nheart, and straightway put it in practice.\n\nA group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty\nthings, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their\nvoices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the\nstory, and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit\nhad come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. She\nheard May say sorrowfully,--\n\n\"It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't\nwant to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just complete then:\nnow it's spoilt.\"\n\n\"I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her,\" suggested some one.\n\n\"How could I after all the fuss?\" began May, but she did not finish, for\nAmy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly,--\n\n\"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I was\njust thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your table\nrather than mine. Here they are; please take them, and forgive me if I\nwas hasty in carrying them away last night.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and\nhurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing\nthan it was to stay and be thanked for it.\n\n\"Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?\" cried one girl.\n\nMay's answer was inaudible; but another young lady, whose temper was\nevidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable\nlaugh, \"Very lovely; for she knew she wouldn't sell them at her own\ntable.\"\n\nNow, that was hard; when we make little sacrifices we like to have them\nappreciated, at least; and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it,\nfeeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is,--as she\npresently discovered; for her spirits began to rise, and her table to\nblossom under her skilful hands; the girls were very kind, and that one\nlittle act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.\n\nIt was a very long day, and a hard one to Amy, as she sat behind her\ntable, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon: few\ncared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long\nbefore night.\n\nThe art-table _was_ the most attractive in the room; there was a crowd\nabout it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro\nwith important faces and rattling money-boxes. Amy often looked\nwistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy,\ninstead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no hardship to\nsome of us; but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious,\nbut very trying; and the thought of being found there in the evening by\nher family, and Laurie and his friends, made it a real martyrdom.\n\nShe did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet\nthat they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no\ncomplaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother gave her\nan extra cordial cup of tea, Beth helped her dress, and made a charming\nlittle wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by getting\nherself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the tables were\nabout to be turned.\n\n\"Don't do anything rude,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a young girl who is trying to conquer her enemy by kindness and following the principle of loving thy neighbor as thyself)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAY<|>PERSON<|>May is another girl who is involved in a conflict with Amy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a friend of Amy's family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is Amy's sister who helps her dress and makes a wreath for her hair)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is another family member who hints at turning the tables)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>MAY<|>Amy offers to return items to May's table and asks for forgiveness, showing kindness and a change of heart<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>BETH<|>Beth helps Amy dress and makes a wreath for her hair, showing support and care<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>LAURIE<|>Laurie is a friend of Amy's family who may provide emotional support<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>JO<|>Jo hints at turning the tables, potentially indicating a change in the situation<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
