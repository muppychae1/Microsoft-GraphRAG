Meg and John\nhappened to be standing together in the middle of the grass-plot, when\nLaurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to\nthis unfashionable wedding.\n\n\"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband\nand wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in\ncouples outside!\" cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy, with\nsuch infectious spirit and skill that every one else followed their\nexample without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol,\nbegan it; others rapidly joined in; even Sallie Moffat, after a moment's\nhesitation, threw her train over her arm, and whisked Ned into the ring.\nBut the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March; for when the\nstately old gentleman _chass√©ed_ solemnly up to the old lady, she just\ntucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join hands\nwith the rest, and dance about the bridal pair, while the young folks\npervaded the garden, like butterflies on a midsummer day.\n\nWant of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people\nbegan to go.\n\n\"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well; but I think you'll\nbe sorry for it,\" said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as\nhe led her to the carriage, \"You've got a treasure, young man, see that\nyou deserve it.\"\n\n\"That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I don't\nsee why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it,\" observed Mrs. Moffat\nto her husband, as they drove away.\n\n\"Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get\none of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly\nsatisfied,\" said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy-chair to\nrest, after the excitement of the morning.\n\n\"I'll do my best to gratify you, sir,\" was Laurie's unusually dutiful\nreply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his button-hole.\n\nThe little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had\nwas the quiet walk with John, from the old home to the new. When she\ncame down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and\nstraw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say\n\"good-by,\" as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.\n\n\"Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love\nyou any the less for loving John so much,\" she said, clinging to her\nmother, with full eyes, for a moment. \"I shall come every day, father,\nand expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I _am_\nmarried. Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls\nwill drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank\nyou all for my happy wedding-day. Good-by, good-by!\"\n\nThey stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender\npride, as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with her hands\nfull of flowers, and the June sunshine brightening her happy face,--and\nso Meg's married life began.\n\n\n\n\n                   [Illustration: Artistic Attempts]\n\n                                 XXVI.\n\n                           ARTISTIC ATTEMPTS.\n\n\nIt takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and\ngenius, especially ambitious young men and women. Amy was learning this\ndistinction through much tribulation; for, mistaking enthusiasm for\ninspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.\nFor a long time there was a lull in the \"mud-pie\" business, and she\ndevoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed\nsuch taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant\nand profitable. But overstrained eyes soon caused pen and ink to be laid\naside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,\nthe family lived in constant fear of a conflagration; for the odor of\nburning wood pervaded the house at all hours; smoke issued from attic\nand shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about\npromiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and\nthe dinner-bell at her door, in case of fire. Raphael's face was found\nboldly executed on the under side of the moulding-board, and Bacchus on\nthe head of a beer-barrel; a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the\nsugar-bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied\nkindlings\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
