To be sure, the hall was so narrow, it was\nfortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in\nwhole; the dining-room was so small that six people were a tight fit;\nand the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of\nprecipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coal-bin. But\nonce get used to these slight blemishes, and nothing could be more\ncomplete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the\nfurnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no\nmarble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little\nparlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a\nstand of flowers in the bay-window, and, scattered all about, the pretty\ngifts which came from friendly hands, and were the fairer for the loving\nmessages they brought.\n\nI don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty\nbecause John put up the bracket it stood upon; that any upholsterer\ncould have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's\nartistic hand; or that any store-room was ever better provided with good\nwishes, merry words, and happy hopes, than that in which Jo and her\nmother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles; and I am morally\ncertain that the spandy-new kitchen never _could_ have looked so cosey\nand neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times\nover, and laid the fire all ready for lighting, the minute \"Mis. Brooke\ncame home.\" I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so\nrich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece-bags; for Beth made enough\nto last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three\ndifferent kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal\nchina.\n\nPeople who hire all these things done for them never know what they\nlose; for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,\nand Meg found so many proofs of this, that everything in her small nest,\nfrom the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was\neloquent of home love and tender forethought.\n\nWhat happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping\nexcursions; what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter\narose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains. In his love of jokes, this\nyoung gentleman, though nearly through college, was as much of a boy as\never. His last whim had been to bring with him, on his weekly visits,\nsome new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a\nbag of remarkable clothes-pins; next, a wonderful nutmeg-grater, which\nfell to pieces at the first trial; a knife-cleaner that spoilt all the\nknives; or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet, and left\nthe dirt; labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands;\ninfallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the\ndeluded buyer; and every kind of tin-ware, from a toy savings-bank for\nodd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own\nsteam, with every prospect of exploding in the process.\n\nIn vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him\n\"Mr. Toodles.\" He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee\ningenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week\nbeheld some fresh absurdity.\n\nEverything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored\nsoaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's setting the table\nfor the first meal.\n\n\"Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you\nshould be happy here?\" asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went\nthrough the new kingdom, arm-in-arm; for just then they seemed to cling\ntogether more tenderly than ever.\n\n\"Yes, mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and _so_ happy\nthat I can't talk about it,\" answered Meg, with a look that was better\nthan words.\n\n\"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,\" said Amy,\ncoming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether\nthe bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantle-piece.\n\n\"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try\nher way first. There will be so little to do, that, with Lotty to run my\nerrands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to\nkeep me from getting lazy or homesick,\" answered Meg tranquilly.\n\n\"Sallie Moffat has four,\" began Amy.\n\n\"If Meg had four the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis\nwould have to camp in the garden,\" broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big\nblue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door-handles.\n\n\"Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
