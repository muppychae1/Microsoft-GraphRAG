Those foolish,\nyet well-meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed\nthe peace of the old one, in which, till now, she had lived as happily\nas a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoilt by the silly\nspeeches she had overheard; her faith in her mother was a little shaken\nby the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others\nby herself; and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple\nwardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter, was weakened by the\nunnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest\ncalamities under heaven.\n\nPoor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half\nresentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not\nspeaking out frankly, and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled\nthat morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even\nto take up their worsted work. Something in the manner of her friends\nstruck Meg at once; they treated her with more respect, she thought;\ntook quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with\neyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this surprised and flattered\nher, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her\nwriting, and said, with a sentimental air,--\n\n\"Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for\nThursday. We should like to know him, and it's only a proper compliment\nto you.\"\n\nMeg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply\ndemurely,--\n\n\"You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't come.\"\n\n\"Why not, _chérie_?\" asked Miss Belle.\n\n\"He's too old.\"\n\n\"My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!\" cried Miss\nClara.\n\n\"Nearly seventy, I believe,\" answered Meg, counting stitches, to hide\nthe merriment in her eyes.\n\n\"You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man,\" exclaimed Miss\nBelle, laughing.\n\n\"There isn't any; Laurie is only a little boy,\" and Meg laughed also at\nthe queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her\nsupposed lover.\n\n\"About your age,\" Nan said.\n\n\"Nearer my sister Jo's; _I_ am seventeen in August,\" returned Meg,\ntossing her head.\n\n\"It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?\" said Annie,\nlooking wise about nothing.\n\n\"Yes, he often does, to all of us; for their house is full, and we are\nso fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,\nso it is quite natural that we children should play together;\" and Meg\nhoped they would say no more.\n\n\"It's evident Daisy isn't out yet,\" said Miss Clara to Belle, with a\nnod.\n\n\"Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,\" returned Miss Belle,\nwith a shrug.\n\n\"I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls; can I do\nanything for you, young ladies?\" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in, like\nan elephant, in silk and lace.\n\n\"No, thank you, ma'am,\" replied Sallie. \"I've got my new pink silk for\nThursday, and don't want a thing.\"\n\n\"Nor I,--\" began Meg, but stopped, because it occurred to her that she\n_did_ want several things, and could not have them.\n\n\"What shall you wear?\" asked Sallie.\n\n\"My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen; it got sadly\ntorn last night,\" said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling\nvery uncomfortable.\n\n\"Why don't you send home for another?\" said Sallie, who was not an\nobserving young lady.\n\n\"I haven't got any other.\" It cost Meg an effort to say that, but Sallie\ndid not see it, and exclaimed, in amiable surprise,--\n\n\"Only that? How funny--\" She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook\nher head at her, and broke in, saying kindly,--\n\n\"Not at all; where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn't\nout? There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen,\nfor I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown, and you\nshall wear it, to please me, won't you, dear?\"\n\n\"You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress, if you don't; it does\nwell enough for a little girl like me,\" said Meg.\n\n\"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to do\nit, and you'd be a regular little beauty, with a touch here and there. I\nsha'n't let any one see you till you are done, and then we'll burst upon\nthem like Cinderella and her godmother, going to the ball,\" said Belle,\nin her persuasive tone.\n\nMeg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she\nwould be \"a little beauty\" after touching up, caused her to accept, and\nforget all her former uncomfortable feelings towards the Moffats.\n\nOn the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid; and,\nbetween them, they turned Meg into a fine lady.
