Jo had sudden\nfits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's\numbrella, which had been left in the hall; Meg was absent-minded, shy,\nand silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was\nmentioned; Amy said \"Every one seemed waiting for something, and\ncouldn't settle down, which was queer, since father was safe at home,\"\nand Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as\nusual.\n\n [Illustration: \"He sat in the big chair by Beth's sofa with the other\n                      three close by.\"--Page 277.]\n\nLaurie went by in the afternoon, and, seeing Meg at the window, seemed\nsuddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down upon one\nknee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands\nimploringly, as if begging some boon; and when Meg told him to behave\nhimself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,\nand staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.\n\n\"What does the goose mean?\" said Meg, laughing, and trying to look\nunconscious.\n\n\"He's showing you how your John will go on by and by. Touching, isn't\nit?\" answered Jo scornfully.\n\n\"Don't say _my John_, it isn't proper or true;\" but Meg's voice lingered\nover the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. \"Please don't plague\nme, Jo; I've told you I don't care _much_ about him, and there isn't to\nbe anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before.\"\n\n\"We can't, for something _has_ been said, and Laurie's mischief has\nspoilt you for me. I see it, and so does mother; you are not like your\nold self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't mean to\nplague you, and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all\nsettled. I hate to wait; so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and\nhave it over quickly,\" said Jo pettishly.\n\n\"_I_ can't say or do anything till he speaks, and he won't, because\nfather said I was too young,\" began Meg, bending over her work, with a\nqueer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with\nher father on that point.\n\n\"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or blush,\nor let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided, No.\"\n\n\"I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should say,\nfor I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares; there's no\nknowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.\"\n\nJo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had\nunconsciously assumed, and which was as becoming as the pretty color\nvarying in her cheeks.\n\n\"Would you mind telling me what you'd say?\" asked Jo more respectfully.\n\n\"Not at all; you are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant,\nand my experience will be useful to you by and by, perhaps, in your own\naffairs of this sort.\"\n\n\"Don't mean to have any; it's fun to watch other people philander, but I\nshould feel like a fool doing it myself,\" said Jo, looking alarmed at\nthe thought.\n\n\"I think not, if you liked any one very much, and he liked you.\" Meg\nspoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane, where she had often\nseen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.\n\n\"I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,\" said Jo,\nrudely shortening her sister's little reverie.\n\n\"Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, 'Thank you, Mr.\nBrooke, you are very kind, but I agree with father that I am too young\nto enter into any engagement at present; so please say no more, but let\nus be friends as we were.'\"\n\n\"Hum! that's stiff and cool enough. I don't believe you'll ever say it,\nand I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the\nrejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"No, I won't. I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk out\nof the room with dignity.\"\n\nMeg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified\nexit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat, and begin to\nsew as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given\ntime. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and, when some one gave\na modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect, which was anything but\nhospitable.\n\n\"Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella,--that is, to see how your\nfather finds himself to-day,\" said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused\nas his eye went from one tell-tale face to the other.\n\n\"It's very well, he's in the rack, I'll get him, and tell it you are\nhere,\" and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in\nher reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her\nspeech and air\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
