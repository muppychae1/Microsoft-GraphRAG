If you'd only set about\nanother task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self again,\nand forget your trouble.\"\n\n\"That's impossible.\"\n\n\"Try it and see. You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, 'Much she\nknows about such things.' I don't pretend to be wise, but I _am_\nobserving, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm\ninterested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies; and,\nthough I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit. Love\nJo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for it's\nwicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the one\nyou want. There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake up and\nbe a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.\"\n\nNeither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little ring on\nhis finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had\nbeen working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,\nmerely saying,--\n\n\"How do you like that?\"\n\nHe looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it\nwas capitally done,--the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless\nface, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the\nlittle wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head.\n\n\"How well you draw!\" he said, with genuine surprise and pleasure at her\nskill, adding, with a half-laugh,--\n\n\"Yes, that's me.\"\n\n\"As you are: this is as you were;\" and Amy laid another sketch beside\nthe one he held.\n\nIt was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it\nwhich atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that a\nsudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked. Only a rough\nsketch of Laurie taming a horse; hat and coat were off, and every line\nof the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude, was full\nof energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued, stood arching\nhis neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot impatiently pawing\nthe ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had\nmastered him. In the ruffled mane, the rider's breezy hair and erect\nattitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of\nstrength, courage, and youthful buoyancy, that contrasted sharply with\nthe supine grace of the \"_Dolce far niente_\" sketch. Laurie said\nnothing; but, as his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush\nup and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little\nlesson she had given him. That satisfied her; and, without waiting for\nhim to speak, she said, in her sprightly way,--\n\n        [Illustration: A rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse]\n\n\"Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all\nlooked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and\nI sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the\nother day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.\"\n\n\"Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I congratulate\nyou. May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon Paradise' that five\no'clock is the dinner-hour at your hotel?\"\n\nLaurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow,\nand looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures\nshould have an end. He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air,\nbut it _was_ an affectation now, for the rousing had been more\nefficacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his\nmanner, and said to herself,--\n\n\"Now I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad; if it makes\nhim hate me, I'm sorry; but it's true, and I can't take back a word of\nit.\"\n\nThey laughed and chatted all the way home; and little Baptiste, up\nbehind, thought that monsieur and mademoiselle were in charming spirits.\nBut both felt ill at ease; the friendly frankness was disturbed, the\nsunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gayety, there\nwas a secret discontent in the heart of each.\n\n\"Shall we see you this evening, _mon frère_?\" asked Amy as they parted\nat her aunt's door.\n\n\"Unfortunately I have an engagement. _Au revoir, mademoiselle_,\" and\nLaurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became\nhim better than many men. Something in his face made Amy say quickly and\nwarmly,--\n\n\"No; be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd\nrather have a hearty English hand-shake than all the sentimental\nsalutations in France.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
