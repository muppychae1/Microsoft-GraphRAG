Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason every one loves\nher and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People wouldn't feel\nhalf so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to have them;\nbut I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm\ngoing to try and be like Beth all I can. I'm apt to forget my\nresolutions; but if I had something always about me to remind me, I\nguess I should do better. May I try this way?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your\nring, dear, and do your best; I think you will prosper, for the sincere\nwish to be good is half the battle. Now I must go back to Beth. Keep up\nyour heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you home again.\"\n\nThat evening, while Meg was writing to her father, to report the\ntraveller's safe arrival, Jo slipped up stairs into Beth's room, and,\nfinding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her\nfingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.\n\n\"What is it, deary?\" asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a face\nwhich invited confidence.\n\n\"I want to tell you something, mother.\"\n\n\"About Meg?\"\n\n\"How quickly you guessed! Yes, it's about her, and though it's a little\nthing, it fidgets me.\"\n\n\"Beth is asleep; speak low, and tell me all about it. That Moffat hasn't\nbeen here, I hope?\" asked Mrs. March rather sharply.\n\n\"No, I should have shut the door in his face if he had,\" said Jo,\nsettling herself on the floor at her mother's feet. \"Last summer Meg\nleft a pair of gloves over at the Laurences', and only one was returned.\nWe forgot all about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke had it. He\nkept it in his waistcoat pocket, and once it fell out, and Teddy joked\nhim about it, and Mr. Brooke owned that he liked Meg, but didn't dare\nsay so, she was so young and he so poor. Now, isn't it a _dread_ful\nstate of things?\"\n\n\"Do you think Meg cares for him?\" asked Mrs. March, with an anxious\nlook.\n\n\"Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!\" cried\nJo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. \"In novels, the girls\nshow it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin, and\nacting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything of the sort: she eats\nand drinks and sleeps, like a sensible creature: she looks straight in\nmy face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit when\nTeddy jokes about lovers. I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't mind me\nas he ought.\"\n\n\"Then you fancy that Meg is _not_ interested in John?\"\n\n\"Who?\" cried Jo, staring.\n\n\"Mr. Brooke. I call him 'John' now; we fell into the way of doing so at\nthe hospital, and he likes it.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! I know you'll take his part: he's been good to father, and\nyou won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to. Mean\nthing! to go petting papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into\nliking him;\" and Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.\n\n\"My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it happened.\nJohn went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so devoted to poor\nfather that we couldn't help getting fond of him. He was perfectly open\nand honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a\ncomfortable home before he asked her to marry him. He only wanted our\nleave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him\nif he could. He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse\nto listen to him; but I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself so\nyoung.\"\n\n\"Of course not; it would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief brewing;\nI felt it; and now it's worse than I imagined. I just wish I could marry\nMeg myself, and keep her safe in the family.\"\n\nThis odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile; but she said gravely, \"Jo, I\nconfide in you, and don't wish you to say anything to Meg yet. When John\ncomes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her feelings\ntoward him.\"\n\n\"She'll see his in those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then\nit will be all up with her. She's got such a soft heart, it will melt\nlike butter in the sun if any one looks sentimentally at her. She read\nthe short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me\nwhen I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an ugly\nname, and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace and\nfun, and cosy times together. I see it all! they'll go lovering around\nthe house, and we\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VERDANTIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Verdantis is a country with a Central Institution that sets interest rates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Central Institution is the Federal Reserve of Verdantis, which is setting interest rates on Monday and Thursday)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Martin Smith is the chair of the Central Institution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET STRATEGY COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Central Institution committee makes key decisions about interest rates and the growth of Verdantis's money supply)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>Martin Smith is the Chair of the Central Institution and will answer questions at a press conference<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
