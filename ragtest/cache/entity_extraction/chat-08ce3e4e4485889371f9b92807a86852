She didn't like the new tone; for, though not _blas√©_, it sounded\nindifferent in spite of the look.\n\n\"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a boy,\" she\nthought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying\nmeantime to seem quite easy and gay.\n\nAt Avigdor's she found the precious home-letters, and, giving the reins\nto Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between\ngreen hedges, where tea-roses bloomed as freshly as in June.\n\n\"Beth is very poorly, mother says. I often think I ought to go home, but\nthey all say 'stay;' so I do, for I shall never have another chance like\nthis,\" said Amy, looking sober over one page.\n\n\"I think you are right, there; you could do nothing at home, and it is a\ngreat comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and enjoying\nso much, my dear.\"\n\nHe drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self, as he said\nthat; and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was lightened,\nfor the look, the act, the brotherly \"my dear,\" seemed to assure her\nthat if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land.\nPresently she laughed, and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her\nscribbling-suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing\nfrom her mouth the words, \"Genius burns!\"\n\nLaurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest-pocket, \"to keep it from\nblowing away,\" and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read\nhim.\n\n\"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the\nmorning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,\" said\nAmy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of\nsplendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.\nWhile Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs\nto the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him,\nwith a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had\nwrought. He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and\napprove; for, overlooking a few little affectations of speech and\nmanner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of\nthat indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call\nelegance. Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain _aplomb_\nin both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman\nof the world than she was; but her old petulance now and then showed\nitself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness was\nunspoiled by foreign polish.\n\nLaurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks, but\nhe saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a pretty\nlittle picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine, which\nbrought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her cheeks,\nthe golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure in the\npleasant scene.\n\nAs they came up on to the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved\nher hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing\nhere and there,--\n\n\"Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the fishermen dragging\ntheir nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert's\nTower, just below, and, best of all, that speck far out to sea which\nthey say is Corsica?\"\n\n\"I remember; it's not much changed,\" he answered, without enthusiasm.\n\n\"What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!\" said Amy, feeling\nin good spirits, and anxious to see him so also.\n\n\"Yes,\" was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the\nisland which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting\nin his sight.\n\n\"Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what you\nhave been doing with yourself all this while,\" said Amy, seating\nherself, ready for a good talk.\n\nBut she did not get it; for, though he joined her, and answered all her\nquestions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the\ncontinent and been to Greece. So, after idling away an hour, they drove\nhome again; and, having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left\nthem, promising to return in the evening.\n\nIt must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately \"prinked\" that night.\nTime and absence had done its work on both the young people; she had\nseen her old friend in a new light, not as \"our boy,\" but as a handsome\nand agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to\nfind favor in his sight. Amy knew her good points, and made the most of\nthem, with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty\nwoman.\n\nTarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
