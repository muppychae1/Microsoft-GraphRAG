Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling that\nthere will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big\none. It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves\nnothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I was first\nmarried, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn, so\nthat I might have the pleasure of mending them; for I got heartily sick\nof doing fancy work and tending my pocket handkerchief.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she\ndoes, to amuse herself, though they never turn out well, and the\nservants laugh at her,\" said Meg.\n\n\"I did, after a while; not to 'mess,' but to learn of Hannah how things\nshould be done, that my servants need _not_ laugh at me. It was play\nthen; but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only\npossessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little\ngirls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You\nbegin at the other end, Meg, dear; but the lessons you learn now will be\nof use to you by and by, when John is a richer man, for the mistress of\na house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if she\nwishes to be well and honestly served.\"\n\n\"Yes, mother, I'm sure of that,\" said Meg, listening respectfully to the\nlittle lecture; for the best of women will hold forth upon the\nall-absorbing subject of housekeeping. \"Do you know I like this room\nmost of all in my baby-house,\" added Meg, a minute after, as they went\nupstairs, and she looked into her well-stored linen-closet.\n\nBeth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves, and\nexulting over the goodly array. All three laughed as Meg spoke; for that\nlinen-closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg married \"that\nBrooke\" she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt March was rather in\na quandary, when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her\nvow. She never broke her word, and was much exercised in her mind how to\nget round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy\nherself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to buy, have made,\nand marked, a generous supply of house and table linen, and send it as\n_her_ present, all of which was faithfully done; but the secret leaked\nout, and was greatly enjoyed by the family; for Aunt March tried to look\nutterly unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the\nold-fashioned pearls, long promised to the first bride.\n\n\"That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a young friend\nwho set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger bowls for\ncompany, and that satisfied her,\" said Mrs. March, patting the damask\ntable-cloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness.\n\n\"I haven't a single finger-bowl, but this is a 'set out' that will last\nme all my days, Hannah says;\" and Meg looked quite contented, as well\nshe might.\n\n\"Toodles is coming,\" cried Jo from below; and they all went down to meet\nLaurie, whose weekly visit was an important event in their quiet lives.\n\nA tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt-basin\nof a hat, and a fly-away coat, came tramping down the road at a great\npace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate,\nstraight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out, and a hearty--\n\n\"Here I am, mother! Yes, it's all right.\"\n\nThe last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him; a\nkindly questioning look, which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the\nlittle ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.\n\n\"For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and compliments.\nBless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are, Jo. Amy, you are\ngetting altogether too handsome for a single lady.\"\n\nAs Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled Beth's\nhair-ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an attitude of\nmock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and every one began\nto talk.\n\n\"Where is John?\" asked Meg anxiously.\n\n\"Stopped to get the license for to-morrow, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Which side won the last match, Teddy?\" inquired Jo, who persisted in\nfeeling an interest in manly sports, despite her nineteen years.\n\n\"Ours, of course. Wish you'd been there to see.\"\n\n\"How is the lovely Miss Randal?\" asked Amy, with a significant smile.\n\n\"More cruel than ever; don't\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
