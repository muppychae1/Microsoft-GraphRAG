Girls are quiet,\nand like to play nurse.\"\n\n\"Don't know any.\"\n\n\"You know us,\" began Jo, then laughed, and stopped.\n\n\"So I do! Will you come, please?\" cried Laurie.\n\n\"I'm not quiet and nice; but I'll come, if mother will let me. I'll go\nask her. Shut that window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.\"\n\nWith that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering\nwhat they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at\nthe idea of having company, and flew about to get ready; for, as Mrs.\nMarch said, he was \"a little gentleman,\" and did honor to the coming\nguest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh collar, and trying\nto tidy up the room, which, in spite of half a dozen servants, was\nanything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, then a decided\nvoice, asking for \"Mr. Laurie,\" and a surprised-looking servant came\nrunning up to announce a young lady.\n\n\"All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo,\" said Laurie, going to the door\nof his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and kind and\nquite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three\nkittens in the other.\n\n\"Here I am, bag and baggage,\" she said briskly. \"Mother sent her love,\nand was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some\nof her blanc-mange; she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her cats\nwould be comforting. I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't refuse,\nshe was so anxious to do something.\"\n\nIt so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing; for, in\nlaughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable\nat once.\n\n\"That looks too pretty to eat,\" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo\nuncovered the dish, and showed the blanc-mange, surrounded by a garland\nof green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.\n\n\"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly, and wanted to show it.\nTell the girl to put it away for your tea: it's so simple, you can eat\nit; and, being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.\nWhat a cosy room this is!\"\n\n\"It might be if it was kept nice; but the maids are lazy, and I don't\nknow how to make them mind. It worries me, though.\"\n\n\"I'll right it up in two minutes; for it only needs to have the hearth\nbrushed, so,--and the things made straight on the mantel-piece so,--and\nthe books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from the\nlight, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now, then, you're fixed.\"\n\nAnd so he was; for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things\ninto place, and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched\nher in respectful silence; and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat\ndown with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully,--\n\n\"How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please take the big\nchair, and let me do something to amuse my company.\"\n\n\"No; I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?\" and Jo looked\naffectionately toward some inviting books near by.\n\n\"Thank you; I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather\ntalk,\" answered Laurie.\n\n\"Not a bit; I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I\nnever know when to stop.\"\n\n\"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home a good deal, and sometimes goes\nout with a little basket?\" asked Laurie, with interest.\n\n\"Yes, that's Beth; she's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.\"\n\n\"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?\"\n\n\"How did you find that out?\"\n\nLaurie colored up, but answered frankly, \"Why, you see, I often hear you\ncalling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help looking\nover at your house, you always seem to be having such good times. I beg\nyour pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the\ncurtain at the window where the flowers are; and when the lamps are\nlighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all\nround the table with your mother; her face is right opposite, and it\nlooks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help watching it. I haven't\ngot any mother, you know;\" and Laurie poked the fire to hide a little\ntwitching of the lips that he could not control.\n\nThe solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart.\nShe had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,\nand at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was\nsick and lonely; and, feeling how rich she was in home-love and\nhappiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very\nfriendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said,--\n\n\"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as\nmuch as you like.
