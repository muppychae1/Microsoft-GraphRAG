It was\nnot a happy evening; for, though they sewed as usual, while their mother\nread aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and\nthe sweet home-peace was disturbed. They felt this most when\nsinging-time came; for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone,\nand Amy broke down, so Meg and mother sung alone. But, in spite of their\nefforts to be as cheery as larks, the flute-like voices did not seem to\nchord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.\n\nAs Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently,--\n\n\"My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger; forgive each other,\nhelp each other, and begin again to-morrow.\"\n\nJo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief\nand anger all away; but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she felt so\ndeeply injured that she really _couldn't_ quite forgive yet. So she\nwinked hard, shook her head, and said, gruffly because Amy was\nlistening,--\n\n\"It was an abominable thing, and she don't deserve to be forgiven.\"\n\nWith that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential\ngossip that night.\n\nAmy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed, and\nbegan to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured than\never, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was\nparticularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thunder-cloud, and\nnothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the morning; she\ndropped her precious turn-over in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack\nof fidgets, Meg was pensive, Beth _would_ look grieved and wistful when\nshe got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always\ntalking about being good, and yet wouldn't try, when other people set\nthem a virtuous example.\n\n\"Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always\nkind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,\" said Jo to herself,\nand off she went.\n\nAmy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient\nexclamation,--\n\n\"There! she promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice we\nshall have. But it's no use to ask such a cross-patch to take me.\"\n\n\"Don't say that; you _were_ very naughty, and it _is_ hard to forgive\nthe loss of her precious little book; but I think she might do it now,\nand I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,\" said Meg. \"Go\nafter them; don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie,\nthen take a quiet minute, and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and\nI'm sure she'll be friends again, with all her heart.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said Amy, for the advice suited her; and, after a flurry to\nget ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over\nthe hill.\n\nIt was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached\nthem. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back; Laurie did not see, for he\nwas carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm\nspell had preceded the cold snap.\n\n\"I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right, before we\nbegin to race,\" Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young\nRussian, in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.\n\nJo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing her\nfingers, as she tried to put her skates on; but Jo never turned, and\nwent slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of\nsatisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished her anger till\nit grew strong, and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and\nfeelings always do, unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the bend,\nhe shouted back,--\n\n\"Keep near the shore; it isn't safe in the middle.\"\n\nJo heard, but Amy was just struggling to her feet, and did not catch a\nword. Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was\nharboring said in her ear,--\n\n\"No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.\"\n\nLaurie had vanished round the bend; Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,\nfar behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the\nriver. For a minute Jo stood still, with a strange feeling at her heart;\nthen she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round,\njust in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
