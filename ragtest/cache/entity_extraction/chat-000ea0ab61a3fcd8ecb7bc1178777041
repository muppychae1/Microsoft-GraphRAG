Some\nversions of the book, such as this one, use the full title of the book\nfrom the title page, _Little Women; Or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy_.\n\nWe used the version of the book from Little, Brown, and Company:\ncopyright 1896, for this transcription. A scanned copy of this book is\navailable through the internet archive, courtesy of the New York Public\nLibrary.\n\nA copy of the first version of the novel, published in 1869, was\nconsulted for emendations, the proper rendering of words hyphenated and\nsplit between two lines for spacing, and other issues in transcribing\nthe novel. We are not trying to change this version of the novel back to\nthe 1869 novel, but correct the errors that were made in re-transcribing\nand updating the text.\n\nPassages in italics were indicated by _underscores_.\n\nPassages in bold were indicated by =equal signs=.\n\nSmall caps were replaced with ALL CAPS.\n\nThroughout the dialogues, there were words used to mimic accents of\nthe speakers. Those words were retained as-is.\n\nErrors in punctuations and hyphenation were not corrected unless\notherwise noted below.\n\nA note about spacing of illustrations: If there are four lines above the\nillustration, then the illustration was at the top of a new chapter. If\nthere are four lines below the illustration, then the illustration was\nat the end of a chapter. If there is two lines between a chapter heading\nand the illustration, then the illustration was an inline illustration\n(usually a drop-cap illustration).\n\nOn page vii, in the Table of Contents, change page 7 to 1 for the\nbeginning of Chapter One.\n\nIn the List of Illustrations, for the illustration on page 147,\n\"postmistress\" was replaced with \"post-mistress\".\n\nIn the List of Illustrations, for the illustration on page 235, \n\"tea-pot\" was replaced with \"teapot\".\n\nOn page 30, the punctuation after 'stained they are' may be a colon, but\non page\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
