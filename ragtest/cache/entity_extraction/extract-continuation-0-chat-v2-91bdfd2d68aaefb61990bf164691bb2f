This vocal exercise\nusually conquered Meg; but John sat as unmoved as the post which is\npopularly believed to be deaf. No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no\nstory; even the light was put out, and only the red glow of the fire\nenlivened the \"big dark\" which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than\nfear. This new order of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for\n\"marmar,\" as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his\ntender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat. The plaintive wail\nwhich succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg's heart, and she ran up\nto say beseechingly,--\n\n\"Let me stay with him; he'll be good, now, John.\"\n\n\"No, my dear, I've told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him; and he\nmust, if I stay here all night.\"\n\n\"But he'll cry himself sick,\" pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for\ndeserting her boy.\n\n\"No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off, and then the matter\nis settled; for he will understand that he has got to mind. Don't\ninterfere; I'll manage him.\"\n\n\"He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by harshness.\"\n\n\"He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoilt by indulgence. Go\ndown, my dear, and leave the boy to me.\"\n\nWhen John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never\nregretted her docility.\n\n\"Please let me kiss him once, John?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Demi, say 'good-night' to mamma, and let her go and rest,\nfor she is very tired with taking care of you all day.\"\n\nMeg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory; for after it\nwas given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom\nof the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.\n\n\"Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying. I'll cover him\nup, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest,\" thought John, creeping to\nthe bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.\n\nBut he wasn't; for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's eyes\nopened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying,\nwith a penitent hiccough, \"Me's dood, now.\"\n\nSitting on the stairs, outside, Meg wondered at the long silence which\nfollowed the uproar; and, after imagining all sorts of impossible\naccidents, she slipped into the room, to set her fears at rest. Demi lay\nfast asleep; not in his usual spread-eagle attitude, but in a subdued\nbunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's arm and holding his\nfather's finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy, and\nhad gone to sleep a sadder and a wiser baby. So held, John had waited\nwith womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold; and, while\nwaiting, had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle with his son than\nwith his whole day's work.\n\nAs Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to\nherself, and then slipped away again, saying, in a satisfied tone,--\n\n\"I never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies: he _does_\nknow how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi _is_ getting\ntoo much for me.\"\n\nWhen John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful\nwife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a bonnet,\nand to be greeted with the request to read something about the election,\nif he was not too tired. John saw in a minute that a revolution of some\nkind was going on, but wisely asked no questions, knowing that Meg was\nsuch a transparent little person, she couldn't keep a secret to save her\nlife, and therefore the clew would soon appear. He read a long debate\nwith the most amiable readiness, and then explained it in his most lucid\nmanner, while Meg tried to look deeply interested, to ask intelligent\nquestions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the\nnation to the state of her bonnet. In her secret soul, however, she\ndecided that politics were as bad as mathematics, and that the mission\nof politicians seemed to be calling each other names; but she kept these\nfeminine ideas to herself, and when John paused, shook her head, and\nsaid with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity,--\n\n\"Well, I really don't see what we are coming to.\"\n\nJohn laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty\nlittle preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it with\nthe genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.\n\n\"She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and like\nmillinery for hers, that's only fair,\" thought John the Just, adding\naloud,--\n\n\"That's very pretty; is it\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a caring mother who is concerned about her child's well-being)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN<|>PERSON<|>John is a father who is firm but loving towards his child)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEMI<|>PERSON<|>Demi is a young child who is tired and emotional)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>DEMI<|>Meg is concerned about Demi's well-being and wants to comfort him<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN<|>DEMI<|>John is firm with Demi but also shows him love and understanding<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>JOHN<|>Meg trusts John to handle their child with care and discipline<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
