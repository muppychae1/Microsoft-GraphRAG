Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee,\nwhich she immediately spilt, thereby making the front of her dress as\nbad as the back.\n\n\"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's glove\nby scrubbing her gown with it.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" said a friendly voice; and there was Laurie, with a\nfull cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.\n\n\"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and some one\nshook me; and here I am, in a nice state,\" answered Jo, glancing\ndismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.\n\n\"Too bad! I was looking for some one to give this to. May I take it to\nyour sister?\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you! I'll show you where she is. I don't offer to take it\nmyself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\"\n\nJo led the way; and, as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a\nlittle table, brought a second instalment of coffee and ice for Jo, and\nwas so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a \"nice boy.\"\nThey had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the\nmidst of a quiet game of \"Buzz,\" with two or three other young people\nwho had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot, and rose\nso quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation\nof pain.\n\n\"Hush! Don't say anything,\" she whispered, adding aloud, \"It's nothing.\nI turned my foot a little, that's all\"; and limped up-stairs to put her\nthings on.\n\nHannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she\ndecided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down,\nand, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It\nhappened to be a hired waiter, who knew nothing about the neighborhood;\nand Jo was looking round for help, when Laurie, who had heard what she\nsaid, came up, and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just\ncome for him, he said.\n\n\"It's so early! You can't mean to go yet?\" began Jo, looking relieved,\nbut hesitating to accept the offer.\n\n\"I always go early,--I do, truly! Please let me take you home? It's all\non my way, you know, and it rains, they say.\"\n\nThat settled it; and, telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully\naccepted, and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah\nhated rain as much as a cat does; so she made no trouble, and they\nrolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and\nelegant. Laurie went on the box; so Meg could keep her foot up, and the\ngirls talked over their party in freedom.\n\n\"I had a capital time. Did you?\" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and\nmaking herself comfortable.\n\n\"Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to\nme, and asked me to come and spend a week with her, when Sallie does.\nShe is going in the spring, when the opera comes; and it will be\nperfectly splendid, if mother only lets me go,\" answered Meg, cheering\nup at the thought.\n\n\"I saw you dancing with the red-headed man I ran away from. Was he\nnice?\"\n\n\"Oh, very! His hair is auburn, not red; and he was very polite, and I\nhad a delicious redowa with him.\"\n\n\"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit, when he did the new step. Laurie\nand I couldn't help laughing. Did you hear us?\"\n\n\"No; but it was very rude. What _were_ you about all that time, hidden\naway there?\"\n\nJo told her adventures, and, by the time she had finished, they were at\nhome. With many thanks, they said \"Good night,\" and crept in, hoping to\ndisturb no one; but the instant their door creaked, two little\nnight-caps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out,--\n\n\"Tell about the party! tell about the party!\"\n\nWith what Meg called \"a great want of manners,\" Jo had saved some\nbonbons for the little girls; and they soon subsided, after hearing the\nmost thrilling events of the evening.\n\n\"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home\nfrom the party in a carriage, and sit in my dressing-gown, with a maid\nto wait on me,\" said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica, and\nbrushed her hair.\n\n\"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we\ndo, in spite of our burnt hair, old gowns, one glove apiece, and tight\nslippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.\"\nAnd I think Jo was quite right.\n\n                  [Illustration: Tell about the party]\n\n\n\n\n     [Illustration: The kitten stuck like a burr just out of reach]\n\n                                  IV.\n\n                                BURDENS.\n\n\n\"Oh dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,\" sighed\nMeg, the morning after the party; for, now the holidays\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
