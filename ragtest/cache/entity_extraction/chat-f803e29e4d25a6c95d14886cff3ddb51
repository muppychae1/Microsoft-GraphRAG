Nice thing, isn't it?\" and Laurie gave them a sample of its\npowers that made them cover up their ears.\n\n\"There's gratitude for you! and speaking of gratitude reminds me to\nmention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding-cake from\ndestruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she\nhadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked\nlike a remarkably plummy one.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,\" said Meg, in a matronly\ntone.\n\n\"I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as six\nfeet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,\" responded the\nyoung gentleman, whose head was about level with the little chandelier.\n\"I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick and\nspan new bower, so, as I'm tremendously hungry, I propose an\nadjournment,\" he added presently.\n\n\"Mother and I are going to wait for John.

I'm in such a state of exhaustion I\ncan't get home without help. Don't take off your apron, whatever you do;\nit's peculiarly becoming,\" said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial\naversion in her capacious pocket, and offered him her arm to support his\nfeeble steps.\n\n\"Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about to-morrow,\" began Jo,\nas they strolled away together. \"You _must_ promise to behave well, and\nnot cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.\"\n\n\"Not a prank.\"\n\n\"And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober.\"\n\n\"I never do; you are the one for that.\"\n\n\"And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony; I shall\ncertainly laugh if you do.\"\n\n\"You won't see me; you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you\nwill obscure the prospect.\"\n\n\"I never cry unless for some great affliction.\"\n\n\"Such as fellows going to college, hey?\" cut in Laurie, with a\nsuggestive laugh.\n\n\"Don't be a peacock.

You wouldn't have me let\nthat fine fellow work himself to death, just for the want of a little\nhelp, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?\"\n\n\"Of course not; but I don't see the use of your having seventeen\nwaistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I\nthought you'd got over the dandy period; but every now and then it\nbreaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be hideous,--to\nmake your head look like a scrubbing-brush, wear a strait-jacket,\norange gloves, and clumping, square-toed boots. If it was cheap\nugliness, I'd say nothing; but it costs as much as the other, and I\ndon't get any satisfaction out of it.\"\n\nL\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
