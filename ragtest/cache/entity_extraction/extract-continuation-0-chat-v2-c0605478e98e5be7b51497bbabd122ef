Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she\npinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she\nbe taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready\nfor either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote,--\n\n                \"DEAR JO,\n                 What ho!\n\n    Some English girls and boys are coming to see me to-morrow and\n    I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going to pitch\n    my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and\n    croquet,--have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all\n    sorts of larks. They are nice people, and like such things.\n    Brooke will go, to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will\n    play propriety for the girls. I want you all to come; can't let\n    Beth off, at any price, and nobody shall worry her. Don't\n    bother about rations,--I'll see to that, and everything\n    else,--only do come, there's a good fellow!\n\n                \"In a tearing hurry,\n                 Yours ever, LAURIE.\"\n\n\"Here's richness!\" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.\n\n\"Of course we can go, mother? it will be such a help to Laurie, for I\ncan row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some\nway.\"\n\n\"I hope the Vaughns are not fine, grown-up people. Do you know anything\nabout them, Jo?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and\nFrank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or\nten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys; I fancied, from the\nway he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn't admire\nKate much.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad my French print is clean; it's just the thing, and so\nbecoming!\" observed Meg complacently. \"Have you anything decent, Jo?\"\n\n\"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row and\ntramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll come,\nBethy?\"\n\n\"If you won't let any of the boys talk to me.\"\n\n\"Not a boy!\"\n\n\"I like to please Laurie; and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so\nkind; but I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. I'll work\nhard, and not trouble any one; and you'll take care of me, Jo, so I'll\ngo.\"\n\n\"That's my good girl; you do try to fight off your shyness, and I love\nyou for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know; and a cheery word\nkind of gives a lift. Thank you, mother,\" and Jo gave the thin cheek a\ngrateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the\nrosy roundness of her youth.\n\n\"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,\" said\nAmy, showing her mail.\n\n\"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to\nhim to-night, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,\" added Beth,\nwhose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.\n\n\"Now let's fly round, and do double duty to-day, so that we can play\nto-morrow with free minds,\" said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a\nbroom.\n\nWhen the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning, to promise\nthem a fine day, he saw a comical sight. Each had made such preparation\nfor the fête as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra row of\nlittle curl-papers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her\nafflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to\natone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by\nputting a clothes-pin on her nose, to uplift the offending feature. It\nwas one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their\ndrawing-boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the\npurpose to which it was now put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse\nthe sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up, and\nroused all her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.\n\n  [Illustration: Amy capped the climax by putting a clothes-pin on her\n                                 nose]\n\nSunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a\nlively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready first, kept\nreporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters' toilets by\nfrequent telegrams from the window.\n\n\"There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch\nin a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the\nsky, and the weathercock; I wish he would go, too.
