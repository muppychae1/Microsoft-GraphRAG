I propose Mr. Theodore\nLaurence as an honorary member of the P. C. Come now, do have him.\"\n\nJo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh; but all looked rather\nanxious, and no one said a word, as Snodgrass took his seat.\n\n\"We'll put it to vote,\" said the President. \"All in favor of this motion\nplease to manifest it by saying 'Ay.'\"\n\nA loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody's surprise, by a\ntimid one from Beth.\n\n\"Contrary minded say 'No.'\"\n\nMeg and Amy were contrary minded; and Mr. Winkle rose to say, with great\nelegance, \"We don't wish any boys; they only joke and bounce about. This\nis a ladies' club, and we wish to be private and proper.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,\"\nobserved Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she\nalways did when doubtful.\n\nUp rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. \"Sir, I give you my word as a\ngentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort. He likes to write, and\nhe'll give a tone to our contributions, and keep us from being\nsentimental, don't you see? We can do so little for him, and he does so\nmuch for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him a place here,\nand make him welcome if he comes.\"\n\nThis artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet,\nlooking as if he had quite made up his mind.\n\n\"Yes, we ought to do it, even if we _are_ afraid. I say he _may_ come,\nand his grandpa, too, if he likes.\"\n\nThis spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her\nseat to shake hands approvingly. \"Now then, vote again. Everybody\nremember it's our Laurie, and say 'Ay!'\" cried Snodgrass excitedly.\n\n\"Ay! ay! ay!\" replied three voices at once.\n\n\"Good! Bless you! Now, as there's nothing like 'taking time by the\n_fetlock_,' as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present\nthe new member;\" and, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw\nopen the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag-bag,\nflushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.\n\n          [Illustration: Jo threw open the door of the closet]\n\n\"You rogue! you traitor!
