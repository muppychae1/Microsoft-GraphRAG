Demi paused to consider the new relationship before\nhe compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took the\ntempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank movement\nproduced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew where to\nhave him.\n\n\"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you\nhit me in the face: now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman;\" and\nwith that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew\nin a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted\nhis boyish soul.\n\n  [Illustration: The tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small\n                                nephew]\n\n\"Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot? Ain't it a relishin'\nsight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks\ncalling little Amy, Mis. Laurence?\" muttered old Hannah, who could not\nresist frequent \"peeks\" through the slide as she set the table in a most\ndecidedly promiscuous manner.\n\nMercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all\nburst out together, trying to tell the history of three years in half an\nhour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and\nprovide refreshment, for they would have been hoarse and faint if they\nhad gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as filed away into the\nlittle dining-room! Mr. March proudly escorted \"Mrs. Laurence;\" Mrs.\nMarch as proudly leaned on the arm of \"my son;\" the old gentleman took\nJo, with a whispered \"You must be my girl now,\" and a glance at the\nempty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, with trembling\nlips, \"I'll try to fill her place, sir.\"\n\nThe twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for\nevery one was so busy with the new-comers that they were left to revel\nat their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the\nopportunity. Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread _ab\nlibitum_, get a hot biscuit apiece, and, as a crowning trespass, didn't\nthey each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets, there\nto stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human nature\nand pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the\nsequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would pierce the\nthin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little\nsinners attached themselves to \"Dranpa,\" who hadn't his spectacles on.\nAmy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on\nFather Laurence's arm; the others paired off as before, and this\narrangement left Jo companionless. She did not mind it at the minute,\nfor she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry,--\n\n\"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (_coupé_), and use all them lovely\nsilver dishes that's stored away over yander?\"\n\n\"Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and\nwore diamonds and point-lace every day. Teddy thinks nothing too good\nfor her,\" returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.\n\n\"No more there is! Will you have hash or fish-balls for breakfast?\"\nasked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.\n\n\"I don't care;\" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an\nuncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at the party\nvanishing above, and, as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last\nstair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she\nlooked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,\nfor even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what birthday gift was\ncoming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to\nherself, \"I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed; it won't do to be\ndismal now.\" Then she drew her hand over her eyes,--for one of her\nboyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was,--and had\njust managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the\nporch-door.\n\nShe opened it with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had\ncome to surprise her; for there stood a tall, bearded gentleman, beaming\non her from the darkness like a midnight sun.\n\n\"O Mr. Bhaer, I _am_ so glad to see you!\" cried Jo, with a clutch, as if\nshe feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in.\n\n          [Illustration: O Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you]\n\n\"And I to see Miss Marsch,--but no, you haf a party--\" and the Professor\npaused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to\nthem.\n\n\"No, we haven't, only the family. My sister and friends have just come\nhome, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us.\"\n\nThough a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously\naway, and come again another day; but how could he, when Jo shut the\ndoor behind him, and bereft him of his hat\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
