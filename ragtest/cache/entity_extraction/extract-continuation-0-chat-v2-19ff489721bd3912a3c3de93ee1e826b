It would be pleasing to the saints if one\nused so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.\"\n\n\"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and\nalways come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I could.\"\n\n\"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort; but, as\nthat is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day, to\nmeditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame.\nShe had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much trouble.\"\n\n\"Would it be right for me to do so too?\" asked Amy, who, in her\nloneliness, felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was\napt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind her\nof it.\n\n\"It would be excellent and charming; and I shall gladly arrange the\nlittle dressing-room for you if you like it. Say nothing to Madame, but\nwhen she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and\npray the dear God to preserve your sister.\"\n\nEsther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice; for she had an\naffectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. Amy\nliked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her\nroom, hoping it would do her good.\n\n\"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March\ndies,\" she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary, and shut the\njewel-cases one by one.\n\n\"To you and your sisters. I know it; Madame confides in me; I witnessed\nher will, and it is to be so,\" whispered Esther, smiling.\n\n\"How nice! but I wish she'd let us have them now. Pro-cras-ti-nation is\nnot agreeable,\" observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.\n\n\"It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The first\none who is affianced will have the pearls--Madame has said it; and I\nhave a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when\nyou go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming manners.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely\nring! It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's. I do like Aunt\nMarch, after all;\" and Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face,\nand a firm resolve to earn it.\n\nFrom that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady\ncomplacently admired the success of her training. Esther fitted up the\ncloset with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a\npicture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought it was of no\ngreat value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that\nMadame would never know it, nor care if she did. It was, however, a very\nvaluable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and Amy's\nbeauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of\nthe divine mother, while tender thoughts of her own were busy at her\nheart. On the table she laid her little Testament and hymn-book, kept a\nvase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every\nday to \"sit alone, thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear God to\npreserve her sister.\" Esther had given her a rosary of black beads, with\na silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful\nas to its fitness for Protestant prayers.\n\nThe little girl was very sincere in all this, for, being left alone\noutside the safe home-nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold\nby so sorely, that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender\nFriend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children.\nShe missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having\nbeen taught where to look, she did her best to find the way, and walk in\nit confidingly. But Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden\nseemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be\nsatisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In\nher first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will,\nas Aunt March had done; so that if she _did_ fall ill and die, her\npossessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang\neven to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were\nas precious as the old lady's jewels.\n\nDuring one of her play-hours she wrote out the important document as\nwell as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms,\nand, when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt\nrelieved, and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second\nwitness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in\none of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company.
