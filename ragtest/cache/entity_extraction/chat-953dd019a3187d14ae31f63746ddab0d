I advise\nyou to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers. I\nmust look after Grace, she is romping;\" and Miss Kate strolled away,\nadding to herself, with a shrug, \"I didn't come to chaperone a\ngoverness, though she _is_ young and pretty. What odd people these\nYankees are; I'm afraid Laurie will be quite spoilt among them.\"\n\n\"I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses,\nand don't treat them as we do,\" said Meg, looking after the retreating\nfigure with an annoyed expression.\n\n\"Tutors, also, have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my\nsorrow. There's no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret;\"\nand Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful, that Meg was ashamed to\nlament her hard lot.\n\n\"I'm glad I live in it then. I don't like my work, but I get a good deal\nof satisfaction out of it after all, so I won't complain; I only wish I\nliked teaching as you do.\"\n\n\"I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil. I shall be very sorry\nto lose him next year,\" said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in the\nturf.\n\n\"Going to college, I suppose?\" Meg's lips asked that question, but her\neyes added, \"And what becomes of you?\"\n\n\"Yes; it's high time he went, for he is ready; and as soon as he is off,\nI shall turn soldier. I am needed.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that!\" exclaimed Meg. \"I should think every young man\nwould want to go; though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay\nat home,\" she added sorrowfully.\n\n\"I have neither, and very few friends, to care whether I live or die,\"\nsaid Mr. Brooke, rather bitterly, as he absently put the dead rose in\nthe hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.\n\n\"Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all\nbe very sorry to have any harm happen to you,\" said Meg heartily.\n\n\"Thank you; that sounds pleasant,\" began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful\nagain; but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old\nhorse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the\nyoung ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.\n\n\"Don't you love to ride?\" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting,\nafter a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.\n\n\"I dote upon it; my sister Meg used to ride when papa was rich, but we\ndon't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree,\" added Amy, laughing.\n\n\"Tell me about Ellen Tree; is it a donkey?\" asked Grace curiously.\n\n                       [Illustration: Ellen Tree]\n\n\"Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses, and so am I, but we've only got\nan old side-saddle, and no horse. Out in our garden is an apple-tree,\nthat has a nice low branch; so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some reins\non the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree whenever we\nlike.\"\n\n\"How funny!\" laughed Grace. \"I have a pony at home, and ride nearly\nevery day in the park, with Fred and Kate; it's very nice, for my\nfriends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Dear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day; but I'd rather\ngo to Rome than the Row,\" said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what\nthe Row was, and wouldn't have asked for the world.\n\nFrank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were\nsaying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as\nhe watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical\ngymnastics. Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author-cards, looked\nup, and said, in her shy yet friendly way,--\n\n\"I'm afraid you are tired; can I do anything for you?\"\n\n\"Talk to me, please; it's dull, sitting by myself,\" answered Frank, who\nhad evidently been used to being made much of at home.\n\nIf he had asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed\na more impossible task to bashful Beth; but there was no place to run\nto, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at\nher, that she bravely resolved to try.\n\n\"What do you like to talk about?\" she asked, fumbling over the cards,\nand dropping half as she tried to tie them up.\n\n\"Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,\" said\nFrank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.\n\n\"My heart! what shall I do? I don't know anything about them,\" thought\nBeth; and, forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry, she said,\nhoping to make him talk, \"I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you\nknow all about it.\"\n\n\"I did once; but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a\nconfounded five-barred gate; so there are no more horses\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
