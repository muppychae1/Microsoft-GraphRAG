Money is a needful and precious\nthing,--and, when well used, a noble thing,--but I never want you to\nthink it is the first or only prize to strive for. I'd rather see you\npoor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on\nthrones, without self-respect and peace.\"\n\n\"Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put\nthemselves forward,\" sighed Meg.\n\n\"Then we'll be old maids,\" said Jo stoutly.\n\n\"Right, Jo; better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or unmaidenly\ngirls, running about to find husbands,\" said Mrs. March decidedly.\n\"Don't be troubled, Meg; poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. Some of\nthe best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so\nlove-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these\nthings to time; make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes\nof your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are\nnot. One thing remember, my girls: mother is always ready to be your\nconfidant, father to be your friend; and both of us trust and hope that\nour daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort\nof our lives.\"\n\n\"We will, Marmee, we will!\" cried both, with all their hearts, as she\nbade them good-night.\n\n\n\n\n                                   X.\n\n                          THE P. C. AND P. O.\n\n\nAs spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the\nlengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.\nThe garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the\nlittle plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, \"I'd know\nwhich each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny;\" and so\nshe might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.\nMeg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange-tree in it.\nJo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying\nexperiments; this year it was to be a plantation of sun-flowers, the\nseeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed \"Aunt\nCockle-top\" and her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned, fragrant\nflowers in her garden,--sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,\npansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the bird, and catnip for\nthe pussies. Amy had a bower in hers,--rather small and earwiggy, but\nvery pretty to look at,--with honeysuckles and morning-glories hanging\ntheir colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it; tall,\nwhite lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants\nas would consent to blossom there.\n\nGardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower-hunts employed the fine\ndays; and for rainy ones, they had house diversions,--some old, some\nnew,--all more or less original. One of these was the \"P. C.\"; for, as\nsecret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one;\nand, as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the\nPickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a\nyear, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which\noccasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged in\na row before a table, on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with\na big \"P. C.\" in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper,\ncalled \"The Pickwick Portfolio,\" to which all contributed something;\nwhile Jo, who revelled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven\no'clock, the four members ascended to the club-room, tied their badges\nround their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as\nthe eldest, was Samuel Pickwick; Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus\nSnodgrass; Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,\nwho was always trying to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.\nPickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original\ntales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which\nthey good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and\nshort-comings.\n\n                      [Illustration: Mr. Pickwick]\n\nOn one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any\nglasses, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and, having stared hard at Mr.\nSnodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself\nproperly, began to read:--\n\n\n                        The Pickwick Portfolio.\n\n                              MAY 20, 18--\n\n                             Poet's Corner.\n\n                            ANNIVERSARY ODE.\n\n        Again we meet to celebrate\n          With badge and solemn rite,\n        Our fifty-second anniversary,\n          In Pickwick Hall, to-night.\n\n        We all are here in perfect health,\n          None gone from our small band;\n        Again we see each well-known face,\n          And press each friendly hand.\n\n        Our Pickwick, always at his post,\n          With reverence we greet,\n        As,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
