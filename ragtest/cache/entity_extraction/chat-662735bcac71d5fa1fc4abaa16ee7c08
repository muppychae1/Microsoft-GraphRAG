As friends you\nare very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over; but I fear\nyou would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much alike\nand too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong wills, to\nget on happily together, in a relation which needs infinite patience and\nforbearance, as well as love.\"\n\n\"That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express it. I'm glad\nyou think he is only beginning to care for me. It would trouble me sadly\nto make him unhappy; for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old\nfellow merely out of gratitude, could I?\"\n\n\"You are sure of his feeling for you?\"\n\nThe color deepened in Jo's cheeks, as she answered, with the look of\nmingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking\nof first lovers,--\n\n\"I'm afraid it is so, mother; he hasn't said anything, but he looks a\ngreat deal. I think I had better go away before it comes to anything.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go.\"\n\nJo looked relieved, and, after a pause, said, smiling, \"How Mrs. Moffat\nwould wonder at your want of management, if she knew; and how she will\nrejoice that Annie still may hope.\"\n\n\"Ah, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is the\nsame in all,--the desire to see their children happy. Meg is so, and I\nam content with her success. You I leave to enjoy your liberty till you\ntire of it; for only then will you find that there is something sweeter.\nAmy is my chief care now, but her good sense will help her. For Beth, I\nindulge no hopes except that she may be well. By the way, she seems\nbrighter this last day or two. Have you spoken to her?\"\n\n\"Yes; she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by and by. I\nsaid no more, for I think I know it;\" and Jo told her little story.\n\nMrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view of the\ncase, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that, for Laurie's\nsake, Jo should go away for a time.\n\n\"Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled; then I'll\nrun away before he can collect his wits and be tragical. Beth must think\nI'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't talk about Laurie to\nher; but she can pet and comfort him after I'm gone, and so cure him of\nthis romantic notion. He's been through so many little trials of the\nsort, he's used to it, and will soon get over his love-lornity.\"\n\nJo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear\nthat this \"little trial\" would be harder than the others, and that\nLaurie would not get over his \"love-lornity\" as easily as heretofore.\n\nThe plan was talked over in a family council, and agreed upon; for Mrs.\nKirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home for her.\nThe teaching would render her independent; and such leisure as she got\nmight be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society\nwould be both useful and agreeable. Jo liked the prospect and was eager\nto be gone, for the home-nest was growing too narrow for her restless\nnature and adventurous spirit. When all was settled, with fear and\ntrembling she told Laurie; but to her surprise he took it very quietly.\nHe had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant; and, when\njokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly, \"So I\nam; and I mean this one shall stay turned.\"\n\nJo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on\njust then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart,--for Beth\nseemed more cheerful,--and hoped she was doing the best for all.\n\n\"One thing I leave to your especial care,\" she said, the night before\nshe left.\n\n\"You mean your papers?\" asked Beth.\n\n\"No, my boy. Be very good to him, won't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I will; but I can't fill your place, and he'll miss you\nsadly.\"\n\n\"It won't hurt him; so remember, I leave him in your charge, to plague,\npet, and keep in order.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, for your sake,\" promised Beth, wondering why Jo looked\nat her so queerly.\n\nWhen Laurie said \"Good-by,\" he whispered significantly, \"It won't do a\nbit of good, Jo. My eye is on you; so mind what you do, or I'll come and\nbring you home.\"\n\n\n\n\n  [Illustration: I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the\n                                 seat]\n\n                                XXXIII.\n\n                             JO'S JOURNAL.\n\n\n                                                \"NEW YORK, November.\n\n    \"DEAR MARMEE AND BETH,--\n\n    \"I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps to\n    tell, though I'm not a fine young lady travelling on the\n    continent.
