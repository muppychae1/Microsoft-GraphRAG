Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that\nsuffering little sister always before her eyes, and that pathetic voice\nsounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of\nBeth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all\nhearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition, to\nlive for others, and make home happy by the exercise of those simple\nvirtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more\nthan talent, wealth, or beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to\nbe at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service\nwould be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how\nmany neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. Laurie\nhaunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the\ngrand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young\nneighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. Every one\nmissed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she\ndid; poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness, and to\nget a shroud for Minna; the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and\ngood wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how\nmany friends shy little Beth had made.\n\nMeanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in\nher wanderings she did not forget her forlorn _protégé_. She longed for\nher cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick;\nand, in her quiet hours, she was full of anxiety about Jo. She sent\nloving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write\nsoon; and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that\nfather might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these\nintervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing\nto and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy\nsleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,\nHannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to\nsend off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.\n\nThe first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind\nblew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its death.\nWhen Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot\nhand in both his own a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low\ntone, to Hannah,--\n\n\"If Mrs. March _can_ leave her husband, she'd better be sent for.\"\n\nHannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously; Meg\ndropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs\nat the sound of those words; and Jo, after standing with a pale face for\na minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and, throwing on\nher things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon back, and, while\nnoiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying\nthat Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy\nweight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of\nmisery that Laurie asked quickly,--\n\n\"What is it? is Beth worse?\"\n\n\"I've sent for mother,\" said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a\ntragical expression.\n\n\"Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?\" asked\nLaurie, as he seated her in the hall chair, and took off the rebellious\nboots, seeing how her hands shook.\n\n\"No, the doctor told us to.\"\n\n\"O Jo, it's not so bad as that?\" cried Laurie, with a startled face.\n\n\"Yes, it is; she doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the\nflocks of green doves, as she calls the vine-leaves on the wall; she\ndoesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it; mother\nand father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find Him.\"\n\nAs the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her\nhand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie\ntook it in his, whispering, as well as he could, with a lump in his\nthroat,--\n\n\"I'm here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!\"\n\nShe could not speak, but she did \"hold on,\" and the warm grasp of the\nfriendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her\nnearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.\nLaurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting\nwords came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as\nher mother used to do. It was the best thing he could have done; far\nmore soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken\nsympathy, and, in the silence, learned the sweet solace which affection\nadministers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her,\nand looked up with a grateful face.\n\n   [Illustration: Gently stroking\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
