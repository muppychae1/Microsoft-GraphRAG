Well, the\nbabies love me; they don't care if I am thin and pale, and haven't time\nto crimp my hair; they are my comfort, and some day John will see what\nI've gladly sacrificed for them, won't he, my precious?\"\n\nTo which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a\ncrow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel, which\nsoothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as\npolitics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss\ninteresting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him.\nNot a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one\nday, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg's drooping\nspirits had not escaped her observation.\n\n\"I wouldn't tell any one except you, mother; but I really do need\nadvice, for, if John goes on so much longer I might as well be widowed,\"\nreplied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's bib, with an injured\nair.\n\n\"Goes on how, my dear?\" asked her mother anxiously.\n\n\"He's away all day, and at night, when I want to see him, he is\ncontinually going over to the Scotts'. It isn't fair that I should have\nthe hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish, even\nthe best of them.\"\n\n\"So are women; don't blame John till you see where you are wrong\nyourself.\"\n\n\"But it can't be right for him to neglect me.\"\n\n\"Don't you neglect him?\"\n\n\"Why, mother, I thought you'd take my part!\"\n\n\"So I do, as far as sympathizing goes; but I think the fault is yours,\nMeg.\"\n\n\"I don't see how.\"\n\n\"Let me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you\nmade it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only leisure\ntime?\"\n\n\"No; but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend.\"\n\n\"I think you could, dear; and I think you ought. May I speak quite\nfreely, and will you remember that it's mother who blames as well as\nmother who sympathizes?\"\n\n\"Indeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often feel\nas if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for\neverything.\"\n\nMeg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and, with a little\ninterruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly\ntogether, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than\never.\n\n\"You have only made the mistake that most young wives make,--forgotten\nyour duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very natural\nand forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be remedied before\nyou take to different ways; for children should draw you nearer than\never, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and John had nothing\nto do but support them. I've seen it for some weeks, but have not\nspoken, feeling sure it would come right in time.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it won't. If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm jealous; and\nI wouldn't insult him by such an idea. He doesn't see that I want him,\nand I don't know how to tell him without words.\"\n\n\"Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away. My dear, he's longing for\nhis little home; but it isn't home without you, and you are always in\nthe nursery.\"\n\n\"Oughtn't I to be there?\"\n\n\"Not all the time; too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you\nare unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to John as well\nas to the babies; don't neglect husband for children, don't shut him out\nof the nursery, but teach him how to help in it. His place is there as\nwell as yours, and the children need him; let him feel that he has his\npart to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be\nbetter for you all.\"\n\n\"You really think so, mother?\"\n\n\"I know it, Meg, for I've tried it; and I seldom give advice unless I've\nproved its practicability. When you and Jo were little, I went on just\nas you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless I devoted myself\nwholly to you. Poor father took to his books, after I had refused all\noffers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I struggled\nalong as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me. I nearly spoilt\nher by indulgence. You were poorly, and I worried about you till I fell\nsick myself. Then father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything,\nand made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake, and never have been\nable to get on without him since. That is the secret of our home\nhappiness: he does not let business wean him from the little cares and\nduties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic worries destroy\nmy interest in his pursuits. Each do our part alone in many things, but\nat home we work together, always.\"\n\n\"It is so, mother;\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
