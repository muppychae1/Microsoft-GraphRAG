Your airs are funny now; but you'll grow up an affected little\ngoose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways\nof speaking, when you don't try to be elegant; but your absurd words are\nas bad as Jo's slang.\"\n\n\"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,\nready to share the lecture.\n\n\"You're a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly; and no one\ncontradicted her, for the \"Mouse\" was the pet of the family.\n\nAs young readers like to know \"how people look,\" we will take this\nmoment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\nknitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\nwithout, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable\nold room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for\na good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\nchrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\npleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it.\n\nMargaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\nplump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet\nmouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\nJo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she\nnever seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\nmuch in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\ngray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\nfunny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it\nwas usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders\nhad Jo, big hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the\nuncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\nwoman, and didn't like it. Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called\nher--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\nmanner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom\ndisturbed. Her father called her \"Little Tranquillity,\" and the name\nsuited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her\nown, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy,\nthough the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at\nleast. A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair, curling\non her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a\nyoung lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four\nsisters were we will leave to be found out.\n\nThe clock struck six; and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\nof slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good\neffect upon the girls; for mother was coming, and every one brightened\nto welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out\nof the easy-chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was\nas she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.\n\n        [Illustration: Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm]\n\n\"They are quite worn out; Marmee must have a new pair.\"\n\n\"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.\n\n\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.\n\n\"I'm the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided--\n\n\"I'm the man of the family now papa is away, and _I_ shall provide the\nslippers, for he told me to take special care of mother while he was\ngone.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Beth; \"let's each get her something\nfor Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"\n\n\"That's like you, dear! What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.\n\nEvery one thought soberly for a minute; then Meg announced, as if the\nidea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give\nher a nice pair of gloves.\"\n\n\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.\n\n\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.\n\n\"I'll get a little bottle of cologne; she likes it, and it won't cost\nmuch, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.\n\n\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\nDon't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.\n\n        [Illustration: I used to be so frightened when it was my\n                     turn to sit in the big chair]\n\n\"I used to be _so_ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big\nchair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the\npresents, with a kiss.
