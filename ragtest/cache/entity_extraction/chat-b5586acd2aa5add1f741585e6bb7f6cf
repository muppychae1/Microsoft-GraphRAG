But\nwhen I saw you all so well and strong, and full of happy plans, it was\nhard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,\nJo.\"\n\n\"O Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and help you! How\ncould you shut me out, and bear it all alone?\"\n\nJo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of\nthe solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say\ngood-by to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.\n\n\"Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right; I wasn't sure, no one\nsaid anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have been selfish to\nfrighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and\nyou so happy with Laurie,--at least, I thought so then.\"\n\n\"And I thought that you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I\ncouldn't,\" cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.\n\nBeth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,\nand added softly,--\n\n\"Then you didn't, deary? I was afraid it was so, and imagined your poor\nlittle heart full of love-lornity all that while.\"\n\n\"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?\" asked Beth, as\ninnocently as a child. \"I do love him dearly; he is so good to me, how\ncan I help it? But he never could be anything to me but my brother. I\nhope he truly will be, sometime.\"\n\n\"Not through me,\" said Jo decidedly. \"Amy is left for him, and they\nwould suit excellently; but I have no heart for such things, now. I\ndon't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You _must_ get well.\"\n\n\"I want to, oh, so much! I try, but every day I lose a little, and feel\nmore sure that I shall never gain it back. It's like the tide, Jo, when\nit turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped.\"\n\n\"It _shall_ be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too\nyoung. Beth, I can't let you go. I'll work and pray and fight against\nit. I'll keep you in spite of everything; there must be ways, it can't\nbe too late. God won't be so cruel as to take you from me,\" cried poor\nJo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously submissive than\nBeth's.\n\nSimple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety; it shows itself\nin acts, rather than in words, and has more influence than homilies or\nprotestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave\nher courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death.\nLike a confiding child, she asked no questions, but left everything to\nGod and nature, Father and mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and\nthey only, could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and\nthe life to come. She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only\nloved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to\nthe dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned,\nbut through which He draws us closer to Himself. She could not say, \"I'm\nglad to go,\" for life was very sweet to her; she could only sob out, \"I\ntry to be willing,\" while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave\nof this great sorrow broke over them together.\n\nBy and by Beth said, with recovered serenity,--\n\n\"You'll tell them this when we go home?\"\n\n\"I think they will see it without words,\" sighed Jo; for now it seemed\nto her that Beth changed every day.\n\n\"Perhaps not; I've heard that the people who love best are often\nblindest to such things. If they don't see it, you will tell them for\nme. I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare them. Meg has\nJohn and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by father and\nmother, won't you, Jo?\"\n\n\"If I can; but, Beth, I don't give up yet; I'm going to believe that it\n_is_ a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true,\" said Jo, trying to\nspeak cheerfully.\n\nBeth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way,--\n\n\"I don't know how to express myself, and shouldn't try, to any one but\nyou, because I can't speak out, except to my Jo. I only mean to say\nthat I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long. I'm\nnot like the rest of you; I never made any plans about what I'd do when\nI grew up; I never thought of being married, as you all did. I couldn't\nseem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about\nat home, of no use anywhere but there. I never wanted to go away, and\nthe hard part now is the leaving you all. I'm not afraid, but it seems\nas if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.\"\n\nJo could not speak; and for several minutes there was no sound but the\nsigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide.
