She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had\nsaid nothing about Tuesday, for her interest, like her cake, was getting\na little stale.\n\n\"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad to-day,\"\nsaid Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of\nplacid despair.\n\n\"Use the chicken, then; the toughness won't matter in a salad,\" advised\nhis wife.\n\n\"Hannah left it on the kitchen-table a minute, and the kittens got at\nit. I'm very sorry, Amy,\" added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.\n\n\"Then I _must_ have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do,\" said Amy\ndecidedly.\n\n\"Shall I rush into town and demand one?\" asked Jo, with the magnanimity\nof a martyr.\n\n\"You'd come bringing it home under your arm, without any paper, just to\ntry me. I'll go myself,\" answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to\nfail.\n\nShrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel travelling-basket, she\ndeparted, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit, and\nfit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her\ndesire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing, to prevent further\nloss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her own\nforethought.\n\nAs the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,\nAmy pocketed her veil, and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to\nfind out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she with her card\nfull of refractory figures that she did not observe a new-comer, who\nentered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,\n\"Good-morning, Miss March,\" and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's\nmost elegant college friends. Fervently hoping that he would get out\nbefore she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and,\ncongratulating herself that she had on her new travelling dress,\nreturned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.\n\nThey got on excellently; for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by\nlearning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting away\nin a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In stumbling to\nthe door, she upset the basket, and--oh, horror!--the lobster, in all\nits vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the highborn eyes of a\nTudor.\n\n\"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!\" cried the unconscious youth,\npoking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing\nto hand out the basket after the old lady.\n\n\"Please don't--it's--it's mine,\" murmured Amy, with a face nearly as red\nas her fish.\n\n                [Illustration: Please don't, it's mine]\n\n\"Oh, really, I beg pardon; it's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?\" said\nTudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest that\ndid credit to his breeding.\n\nAmy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,\nand said, laughing,--\n\n\"Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad he's to make, and to\nsee the charming young ladies who are to eat it?\"\n\nNow that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind\nwere touched: the lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing\nreminiscences, and curiosity about \"the charming young ladies\" diverted\nhis mind from the comical mishap.\n\n\"I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I sha'n't see\nthem; that's a comfort,\" thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.\n\nShe did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that,\nthanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of\ndressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the\npreparations which now seemed more irksome than before; and at twelve\no'clock all was ready again. Feeling that the neighbors were interested\nin her movements, she wished to efface the memory of yesterday's\nfailure by a grand success to-day; so she ordered the \"cherry-bounce,\"\nand drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.\n\n\"There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go into the porch to meet\nthem; it looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good time\nafter all her trouble,\" said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the word.\nBut after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression,\nfor, looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.\n\n\"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table; it will\nbe too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,\" cried\nJo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even for a\nlaugh.\n\nIn came Amy, quite calm, and delightfully cordial to the one guest who\nhad kept her promise; the rest of the family, being of a dramatic turn,\nplayed\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FEAST<|>EVENT<|>A gathering where perishable portions are consumed to prevent waste)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>A character who is preparing for a gathering and facing challenges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
