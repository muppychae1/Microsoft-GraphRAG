Then she remembered her mother's\npromise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little\ncrimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful\nold story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true\nguide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey. She woke Meg with a\n\"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her pillow. A\ngreen-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few\nwords written by their mother, which made their one present very\nprecious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find\ntheir little books also,--one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat\nlooking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the\ncoming day.\n\nIn spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\nwhich unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her\nvery tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.\n\n\"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to\nthe two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"mother wants us to\nread and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used\nto be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war\ntrouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you\nplease; but _I_ shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little\nevery morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help\nme through the day.\"\n\nThen she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round\nher, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\nso seldom seen on her restless face.\n\n\"How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with the\nhard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,\"\nwhispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters'\nexample.\n\n\"I'm glad mine is blue,\" said Amy; and then the rooms were very still\nwhile the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\ntouch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.\n\n\"Where is mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\ntheir gifts, half an hour later.\n\n\"Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin', and your ma went\nstraight off to see what was needed. There never _was_ such a woman for\ngivin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',\" replied Hannah, who\nhad lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them\nall more as a friend than a servant.\n\n\"She will be back soon, I think; so fry your cakes, and have everything\nready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a\nbasket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.\n\"Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?\" she added, as the little flask\ndid not appear.\n\n\"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on\nit, or some such notion,\" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the\nfirst stiffness off the new army-slippers.\n\n\"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and ironed\nthem for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly\nat the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\n\n\"Bless the child! she's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.\nMarch.' How funny!\" cried Jo, taking up one.\n\n\"Isn't it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's\ninitials are 'M. M.,' and I don't want any one to use these but Marmee,\"\nsaid Beth, looking troubled.\n\n\"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea,--quite sensible, too, for\nno one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know,\" said\nMeg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\n\n\"There's mother. Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed,\nand steps sounded in the hall.\n\nAmy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\nall waiting for her.\n\n\"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\" asked Meg,\nsurprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\nearly.\n\n\"Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean any one should know till the time\ncame. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave\n_all_ my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any\nmore.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\none; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\nherself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \"a\ntrump,\" while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\nornament the stately bottle.\n\n\"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\nbeing good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\nminute I was up: and I'm _so_ glad, for mine\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
