The remodelled lunch being gayly partaken of, the\nstudio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, Amy\nordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce!) and drove her\nfriend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when \"the party went\nout.\"\n\nAs she came walking in, looking very tired, but as composed as ever, she\nobserved that every vestige of the unfortunate _fÃªte_ had disappeared,\nexcept a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.\n\n\"You've had a lovely afternoon for your drive, dear,\" said her mother,\nas respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.\n\n\"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I\nthought,\" observed Beth, with unusual warmth.\n\n\"Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so\nmuch company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours,\" asked Meg\nsoberly.\n\n\"Take it all; I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it will\nmould before I can dispose of it,\" answered Amy, thinking with a sigh of\nthe generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.\n\n\"It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us,\" began Jo, as they sat down\nto ice-cream and salad for the second time in two days.\n\nA warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the\nwhole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,\n\"Salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn\"--here\na general explosion of laughter cut short the \"history of sallets,\" to\nthe great surprise of the learned gentleman.\n\n\"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels: Germans\nlike messes. I'm sick of the sight of this; and there's no reason you\nshould all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool,\" cried Amy, wiping\nher eyes.\n\n\"I thought I _should_ have died when I saw you two girls rattling about\nin the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big nutshell,\nand mother waiting in state to receive the throng,\" sighed Jo, quite\nspent with laughter.\n\n\"I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to\nsatisfy you,\" said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.\n\n\"I _am_ satisfied; I've done what I undertook, and it's not my fault\nthat it failed; I comfort myself with that,\" said Amy, with a little\nquiver in her voice. \"I thank you all very much for helping me, and I'll\nthank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at least.\"\n\nNo one did for several months; but the word \"_fÃªte_\" always produced a\ngeneral smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral\nlobster in the shape of a charm for her watch-guard.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                    [Illustration: Literary Lessons]\n\n                                 XXVII.\n\n                           LITERARY LESSONS.\n\n\nFortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good-luck penny in her\npath. Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would\nhave given more real happiness than did the little sum that came to her\nin this wise.\n\nEvery few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her\nscribbling suit, and \"fall into a vortex,\" as she expressed it, writing\naway at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was\nfinished she could find no peace. Her \"scribbling suit\" consisted of a\nblack woollen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a\ncap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which\nshe bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. This cap\nwas a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these\nperiods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads\nsemi-occasionally, to ask, with interest, \"Does genius burn, Jo?\" They\ndid not always venture even to ask this question, but took an\nobservation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive\narticle of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that\nhard work was going on; in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly\naskew; and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and\ncast upon the floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew; and\nnot until the red bow was seen gayly erect upon the gifted brow, did any\none dare address Jo.\n\nShe did not think herself a genius by any means; but when the writing\nfit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a\nblissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat\nsafe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a member of the family who hosted a luncheon for twelve guests)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth helped clear the table for the luncheon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANNAH<|>PERSON<|>Hannah helped clear the table for the luncheon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a member of the family who hosted a luncheon for twelve guests)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISS ELLIOTT<|>PERSON<|>Miss Elliott is a guest at the luncheon hosted by the family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a member of the family who hosted a luncheon for twelve guests)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
