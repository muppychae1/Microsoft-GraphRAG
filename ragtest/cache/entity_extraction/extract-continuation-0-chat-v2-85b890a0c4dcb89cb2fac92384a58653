She never knew that Mr. Laurence often opened his\nstudy-door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked; she never saw Laurie\nmount guard in the hall to warn the servants away; she never suspected\nthat the exercise-books and new songs which she found in the rack were\nput there for her especial benefit; and when he talked to her about\nmusic at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that\nhelped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what\nisn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped.\nPerhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a\ngreater was given her; at any rate, she deserved both.\n\n        [Illustration: Mr. Laurence often opened his study door]\n\n\"Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so\nkind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do\nit?\" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.\n\n\"Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking\nhim. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making\nup,\" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth's\nrequests, because she so seldom asked anything for herself.\n\nAfter many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,\nthe materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet\ncheerful pansies, on a deeper purple ground, was pronounced very\nappropriate and pretty; and Beth worked away early and late, with\noccasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needle-woman,\nand they were finished before any one got tired of them. Then she wrote\na very short, simple note, and, with Laurie's help, got them smuggled on\nto the study-table one morning before the old gentleman was up.\n\nWhen this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All\nthat day passed, and a part of the next, before any acknowledgment\narrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety\nfriend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an\nerrand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As\nshe came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four, heads\npopping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,\nseveral hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed,--\n\n\"Here's a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!\"\n\n\"O Beth, he's sent you--\" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy;\nbut she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.\n\nBeth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door, her sisters\nseized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all\npointing, and all saying at once, \"Look there! look there!\" Beth did\nlook, and turned pale with delight and surprise; for there stood a\nlittle cabinet-piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed,\nlike a sign-board, to \"Miss Elizabeth March.\"\n\n\"For me?\" gasped Beth, holding on to Jo, and feeling as if she should\ntumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.\n\n\"Yes; all for you, my precious! Isn't it splendid of him? Don't you\nthink he's the dearest old man in the world? Here's the key in the\nletter. We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he says,\" cried\nJo, hugging her sister, and offering the note.\n\n\"You read it! I can't, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!\" and Beth\nhid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.\n\nJo opened the paper, and began to laugh, for the first words she saw\nwere,--\n\n    \"MISS MARCH:\n\n        \"_Dear Madam_,--\"\n\n\"How nice it sounds! I wish some one would write to me so!\" said Amy,\nwho thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.\n\n    \"'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had\n    any that suited me so well as yours,'\" continued Jo.\n    \"'Heart's-ease is my favorite flower, and these will always\n    remind me of the gentle giver. I like to pay my debts; so I\n    know you will allow \"the old gentleman\" to send you something\n    which once belonged to the little granddaughter he lost. With\n    hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain,\n\n    \"'Your grateful friend and humble servant,\n\n                                        \"'JAMES LAURENCE.'\"\n\n\"There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure!
