A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted\nhimself to the ladies, who pronounced him \"a fascinating dear,\" and a\nGerman Serene Something, having come for the supper alone, roamed\nvaguely about, seeking what he might devour. Baron Rothschild's private\nsecretary, a large-nosed Jew, in tight boots, affably beamed upon the\nworld, as if his master's name crowned him with a golden halo; a stout\nFrenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,\nand Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little\nfamily of eight. Of course, there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced\nAmerican girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto, and a few\nplain but piquante French demoiselles; likewise the usual set of\ntravelling young gentlemen, who disported themselves gayly, while mammas\nof all nations lined the walls, and smiled upon them benignly when they\ndanced with their daughters.\n\nAny young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she \"took the stage\"\nthat night, leaning on Laurie's arm. She knew she looked well, she loved\nto dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ball-room,\nand enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls\nfirst discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by\nvirtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. She did pity the Davis girls,\nwho were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim papa and\nthree grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her friendliest\nmanner as she passed; which was good of her, as it permitted them to see\nher dress, and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking\nfriend might be. With the first burst of the band, Amy's color rose, her\neyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap the floor impatiently; for\nshe danced well, and wanted Laurie to know it: therefore the shock she\nreceived can better be imagined than described, when he said, in a\nperfectly tranquil tone,--\n\n\"Do you care to dance?\"\n\n\"One usually does at a ball.\"\n\nHer amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as\nfast as possible.\n\n\"I meant the first dance. May I have the honor?\"\n\n\"I can give you one if I put off the Count. He dances divinely; but he\nwill excuse me, as you are an old friend,\" said Amy, hoping that the\nname would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be\ntrifled with.\n\n\"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support\n\n        \"'A daughter of the gods,\n          Divinely tall, and most divinely fair,'\"\n\nwas all the satisfaction she got, however.\n\nThe set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy\nwas compelled to walk decorously through a cotillon, feeling all the\nwhile as if she could dance the Tarantula with a relish. Laurie resigned\nher to the \"nice little boy,\" and went to do his duty to Flo, without\nsecuring Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of\nforethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself\ntill supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs of penitence.\nShe showed him her ball-book with demure satisfaction when he strolled,\ninstead of rushing, up to claim her for the next, a glorious\npolka-redowa; but his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when\nshe gallopaded away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt\nwith an actual expression of relief.\n\nThat was unpardonable; and Amy took no more notice of him for a long\nwhile, except a word now and then, when she came to her chaperon,\nbetween the dances, for a necessary pin or a moment's rest. Her anger\nhad a good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and\nseemed unusually blithe and brilliant. Laurie's eyes followed her with\npleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit\nand grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be. He very\nnaturally fell to studying her from this new point of view; and, before\nthe evening was half over, had decided that \"little Amy was going to\nmake a very charming woman.\"\n\nIt was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took\npossession of every one, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,\nhearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, and banged\nas if they enjoyed it; everybody danced who could, and those who\ncouldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. The air was dark\nwith Davises, and many Joneses gambolled like a flock of young giraffes.\nThe golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor, with a\ndashing Frenchwoman, who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train.\nThe Serene Teuton found the supper-table, and was happy, eating steadily\nthrough the bill of fare, and dismayed the _garÃ§ons_ by the ravages
