After the reading came\nthe lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that night,\nand the cocked-hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment. The Professor\ndidn't know what to make of her, and stopped at last, to ask, with an\nair of mild surprise that was irresistible,--\n\n\"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no\nrespect for me, that you go on so bad?\"\n\n\"How can I be respectful, sir, when you forget to take your hat off?\"\nsaid Jo.\n\nLifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt\nand removed the little cocked-hat, looked at it a minute, and then threw\nback his head, and laughed like a merry bass-viol.\n\n\"Ah! I see him now; it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my cap.\nWell, it is nothing; but see you, if this lesson goes not well, you too\nshall wear him.\"\n\nBut the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes, because Mr. Bhaer\ncaught sight of a picture on the hat, and, unfolding it, said, with an\nair of great disgust,--\n\n\"I wish these papers did not come in the house; they are not for\nchildren to see, nor young people to read. It is not well, and I haf no\npatience with those who make this harm.\"\n\nJo glanced at the sheet, and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a\nlunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She did not like it; but the\nimpulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure, but fear,\nbecause, for a minute, she fancied the paper was the \"Volcano.\" It was\nnot, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that, even if it\nhad been, and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no name\nto betray her. She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a blush;\nfor, though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more than\npeople fancied. He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the\nnewspaper offices more than once; but as she never spoke of it, he asked\nno questions, in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it\noccurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it\ntroubled him. He did not say to himself, \"It is none of my business;\nI've no right to say anything,\" as many people would have done; he only\nremembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from mother's\nlove and father's care; and he was moved to help her with an impulse as\nquick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to\nsave a baby from a puddle. All this flashed through his mind in a\nminute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face; and by the time the\npaper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready to say quite\nnaturally, but very gravely,--\n\n\"Yes, you are right to put it from you. I do not like to think that good\nyoung girls should see such things. They are made pleasant to some, but\nI would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad\ntrash.\"\n\n\"All may not be bad, only silly, you know; and if there is a demand for\nit, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people\nmake an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,\" said\nJo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits\nfollowed her pin.\n\n\"There is a demand for whiskey, but I think you and I do not care to\nsell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would\nnot feel that the living _was_ honest. They haf no right to put poison\nin the sugar-plum, and let the small ones eat it. No; they should think\na little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.\"\n\nMr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in\nhis hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her; for her\ncheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke, and gone\nharmlessly up the chimney.\n\n\"I should like much to send all the rest after him,\" muttered the\nProfessor, coming back with a relieved air.\n\nJo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her\nhard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.\nThen she thought consolingly to herself, \"Mine are not like that; they\nare only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried;\" and taking up her\nbook, she said, with a studious face,--\n\n\"Shall we\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
