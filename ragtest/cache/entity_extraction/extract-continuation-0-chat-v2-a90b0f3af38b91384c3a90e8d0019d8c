Amy and you change places in my\nheart, that's all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have come\nabout naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me; but I never\ncould be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong\nand violent; and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it\n_was_ one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of\nmyself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that\nI didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love both\nalike; but I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything\nseemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, and\nI felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with\nthe new; that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife\nAmy, and love them both dearly. Will you believe it, and go back to the\nhappy old times when we first knew one another?\"\n\n\"I'll believe it, with all my heart; but, Teddy, we never can be boy and\ngirl again: the happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't expect\nit. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for playtime is\nover, and we must give up frolicking. I'm sure you feel this; I see the\nchange in you, and you'll find it in me. I shall miss my boy, but I\nshall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be\nwhat I hoped he would. We can't be little playmates any longer, but we\nwill be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives,\nwon't we, Laurie?\"\n\nHe did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his\nface down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish\npassion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them\nboth. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming home\nto be a sad one,--\n\n\"I can't make it true that you children are really married, and going to\nset up housekeeping. Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning\nAmy's pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me, how\ntime does fly!\"\n\n\"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so like\na grandma. I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed,' as Peggotty said\nof David; and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a precocious\ninfant,\" said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.\n\n\"You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in\nfeeling, Teddy. Women always are; and this last year has been such a\nhard one that I feel forty.\"\n\n\"Poor Jo! we left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You\n_are_ older; here's a line, and there's another; unless you smile, your\neyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear\non it. You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.\nWhat a selfish beast I've been!\" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a\nremorseful look.\n\nBut Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone\nwhich she tried to make quite cheerful,--\n\n\"No, I had father and mother to help me, the dear babies to comfort me,\nand the thought that you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the\ntroubles here easier to bear. I _am_ lonely, sometimes, but I dare say\nit's good for me, and--\"\n\n\"You never shall be again,\" broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,\nas if to fence out every human ill. \"Amy and I can't get on without\nyou, so you must come and teach 'the children' to keep house, and go\nhalves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and all\nbe blissfully happy and friendly together.\"\n\n\"If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant. I begin to\nfeel quite young already; for, somehow, all my troubles seemed to fly\naway when you came. You always were a comfort, Teddy;\" and Jo leaned her\nhead on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill, and\nLaurie told her to hold on to him.\n\nHe looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was\nsmiling to herself, as if, in truth, her troubles _had_ all vanished at\nhis coming.\n\n\"You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and\nlaughing the next. You look a little wicked now; what is it, grandma?\"\n\n\"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.\"\n\n\"Like angels!\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, at first; but which rules?\"\n\n\"I don't mind telling you that she does, now; at least I let her think\nso,--it pleases her, you know. By and by we shall take turns, for\nmarriage, they say,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a woman who is loved by the speaker and has a strong friendship with Jo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a woman who has a strong friendship with the speaker and is loved by the speaker)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a man who has a strong friendship with Jo and Amy)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>JO<|>Amy and Jo change places in the speaker's heart, indicating a close relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>JO<|>Laurie and Jo have a strong friendship and support each other<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>AMY<|>Laurie and Amy have a close relationship and get along well<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
