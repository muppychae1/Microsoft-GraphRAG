The family were all busy in the back part\nof the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise\nthem. She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she\nhad seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.\n\n\"Bless me, what's all this?\" cried the old lady, with a rap of her cane,\nas she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.\n\n               [Illustration: Bless me, what's all this?]\n\n\"It's father's friend. I'm _so_ surprised to see you!\" stammered Meg,\nfeeling that she was in for a lecture now.\n\n\"That's evident,\" returned Aunt March, sitting down. \"But what is\nfather's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief\ngoing on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,\" with another rap.\n\n\"We were merely talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,\" began Meg,\nwishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.\n\n\"Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about it. Jo\nblundered into a wrong message in one of your father's letters, and I\nmade her tell me. You haven't gone and accepted him, child?\" cried Aunt\nMarch, looking scandalized.\n\n\"Hush! he'll hear. Sha'n't I call mother?\" said Meg, much troubled.\n\n\"Not yet. I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind at once.\nTell me, do you mean to marry this Cook? If you do, not one penny of my\nmoney ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible girl,\" said the\nold lady impressively.\n\nNow Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of\nopposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The best of us\nhave a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in\nlove. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would\nprobably have declared she couldn't think of it; but as she was\nperemptorily ordered _not_ to like him, she immediately made up her mind\nthat she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision\neasy, and, being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with\nunusual spirit.\n\n\"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money\nto any one you like,\" she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.\n\n\"Highty tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, miss? You'll be\nsorry for it, by and by, when you've tried love in a cottage, and found\nit a failure.\"\n\n\"It can't be a worse one than some people find in big houses,\" retorted\nMeg.\n\nAunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did\nnot know her in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so\nbrave and independent,--so glad to defend John, and assert her right to\nlove him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and,\nafter a little pause, made a fresh start, saying, as mildly as she\ncould, \"Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable, and take my advice. I mean it\nkindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake\nat the beginning. You ought to marry well, and help your family; it's\nyour duty to make a rich match, and it ought to be impressed upon you.\"\n\n\"Father and mother don't think so; they like John, though he _is_ poor.\"\n\n\"Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than two babies.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it,\" cried Meg stoutly.\n\nAunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. \"This Rook is\npoor, and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?\"\n\n\"No; but he has many warm friends.\"\n\n\"You can't live on friends; try it, and see how cool they'll grow. He\nhasn't any business, has he?\"\n\n\"Not yet; Mr. Laurence is going to help him.\"\n\n\"That won't last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow, and not\nto be depended on. So you intend to marry a man without money, position,\nor business, and go on working harder than you do now, when you might be\ncomfortable all your days by minding me and doing better? I thought you\nhad more sense, Meg.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do better if I waited half my life! John is good and wise;\nhe's got heaps of talent; he's willing to work, and sure to get on, he's\nso energetic and brave. Every one likes and respects him, and I'm proud\nto think he cares for me, though I'm so poor and young and silly,\" said\nMeg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.\n\n\"He knows _you_ have got rich relations, child; that's the secret of his\nliking, I suspect.\"\n\n\"Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above such meanness,\nand I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so,\" cried Meg\nindignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's\nsuspicions. \"My John wouldn't marry for money, anymore than I would.
