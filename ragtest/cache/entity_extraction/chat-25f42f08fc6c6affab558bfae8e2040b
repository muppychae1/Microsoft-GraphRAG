Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and every one settled\nthemselves to a hearty meal; for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise\ndevelops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was; for everything\nseemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a\nvenerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the\ntable, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates; acorns dropped\ninto the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without\nbeing invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree, to see\nwhat was going on. Three white-headed children peeped over the fence,\nand an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river\nwith all his might and main.\n\n        [Illustration: \"A very merry lunch it was.\"--Page 156.]\n\n\"There's salt here, if you prefer it,\" said Laurie, as he handed Jo a\nsaucer of berries.\n\n\"Thank you, I prefer spiders,\" she replied, fishing up two unwary little\nones who had gone to a creamy death. \"How dare you remind me of that\nhorrid dinner-party, when yours is so nice in every way?\" added Jo,\nas they both laughed, and ate out of one plate, the china having run\nshort.\n\n\"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet.\nThis is no credit to me, you know; I don't do anything; it's you and Meg\nand Brooke who make it go, and I'm no end obliged to you. What shall we\ndo when we can't eat any more?\" asked Laurie, feeling that his trump\ncard had been played when lunch was over.\n\n\"Have games, till it's cooler. I brought 'Authors,' and I dare say Miss\nKate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her; she's company, and\nyou ought to stay with her more.\"\n\n\"Aren't you company too? I thought she'd suit Brooke; but he keeps\ntalking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous\nglass of hers. I'm going, so you needn't try to preach propriety, for\nyou can't do it, Jo.\"\n\nMiss Kate did know several new games; and as the girls would not, and\nthe boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing-room\nto play \"Rigmarole.\"\n\n\"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as\nhe pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when\nthe next takes it up and does the same. It's very funny when well done,\nand makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over.\nPlease start it, Mr. Brooke,\" said Kate, with a commanding air, which\nsurprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other\ngentleman.\n\nLying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke\nobediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed\nupon the sunshiny river.\n\n\"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,\nfor he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He travelled a long\nwhile, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he\ncame to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to any\none who would tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was\nvery fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely; for\nthe colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master,\nthough he was freakish and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to\nthis pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city; and, as\nhe rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had\nseen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went\nprancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle\nthe lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old\ncastle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by\na spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The\nknight wished intensely that he could free them; but he was poor, and\ncould only go by each day, watching for the sweet face, and longing to\nsee it out in the sunshine. At last, he resolved to get into the castle\nand ask how he could help them. He went and knocked; the great door flew\nopen, and he beheld--\"\n\n          [Illustration: He went prancing down a quiet street]\n\n\"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, 'At\nlast! at last!'\" continued Kate, who had read French novels, and admired\nthe style. \"''Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her feet in an\necstasy of joy. 'Oh, rise!' she said, extending a hand of marble\nfairness. 'Never! till you tell me how I may rescue you,' swore the\nknight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here\ntill my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?'
