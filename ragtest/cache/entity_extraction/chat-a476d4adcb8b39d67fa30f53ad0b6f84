I think of them, but it takes too much\ntime to do them; so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and let\nthe small ones slip; but they tell best in the end, I fancy.\"\n\nAmy smiled, and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,--\n\n\"Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones; for they\nhave no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you'd\nremember that, and practise it, you'd be better liked than I am, because\nthere is more of you.\"\n\n\"I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing to own\nthat you are right; only it's easier for me to risk my life for a person\nthan to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it. It's a great\nmisfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's a greater not to be able to hide them. I don't mind saying that I\ndon't approve of Tudor any more than you do; but I'm not called upon to\ntell him so; neither are you, and there is no use in making yourself\ndisagreeable because he is.\"\n\n\"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men; and\nhow can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any\ngood, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddy to manage; but there\nare many little ways in which I can influence him without a word, and I\nsay we _ought_ to do it to others if we can.\"\n\n\"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample of other\nboys,\" said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have\nconvulsed the \"remarkable boy,\" if he had heard it. \"If we were belles,\nor women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps; but for\nus to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don't approve of\nthem, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn't have a particle\nof effect, and we should only be considered odd and puritanical.\"\n\n\"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely\nbecause we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's a nice sort\nof morality.\"\n\n\"I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of the world; and\npeople who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their\npains. I don't like reformers, and I hope you will never try to be one.\"\n\n\"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can; for in spite of the\nlaughing, the world would never get on without them. We can't agree\nabout that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new: you will\nget on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should\nrather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.\"\n\n\"Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry aunt with your new ideas.\"\n\n\"I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with some\nparticularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her; it's my\ndoom, and I can't help it.\"\n\nThey found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very\ninteresting subject; but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a\nconscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their\nnieces. Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned; but\nAmy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper, and pleased\neverybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind. This amiable spirit was\nfelt at once, and both the aunts \"my deared\" her affectionately, looking\nwhat they afterwards said emphatically,--\"That child improves every\nday.\"\n\n\"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy\nsat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well\nin the young.\n\n\"Yes, aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a\ntable, as I have nothing but my time to give.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" put in Jo decidedly. \"I hate to be patronized, and the\nChesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with their highly\nconnected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy: they only want you to\nwork.\"\n\n\"I am willing to work: it's for the freedmen as well as the Chesters,\nand I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun.\nPatronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.\"\n\n\"Quite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear; it's a\npleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts: some do not, and\nthat is trying,\" observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at Jo,\nwho sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.\n\n                [Illustration: The call at Aunt March's]\n\nIf Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance\nfor one of them, she would have turned dovelike in a minute; but,\nunfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot see what\ngoes on in the minds of our friends; better for us that we cannot as a\ngeneral thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a\nsaving of time and temper.
