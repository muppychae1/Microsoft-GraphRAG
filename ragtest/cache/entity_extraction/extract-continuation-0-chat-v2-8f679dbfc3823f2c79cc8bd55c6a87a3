Think what luxury,--Plumfield my own, and a\nwilderness of boys to enjoy it with me!\"\n\nAs Jo waved her hands, and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off\ninto a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought\nhe'd have an apoplectic fit.\n\n\"I don't see anything funny,\" she said gravely, when she could be heard.\n\"Nothing could be more natural or proper than for my Professor to open a\nschool, and for me to prefer to reside on my own estate.\"\n\n\"She is putting on airs already,\" said Laurie, who regarded the idea in\nthe light of a capital joke. \"But may I inquire how you intend to\nsupport the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins, I'm\nafraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs. Bhaer.\"\n\n\"Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have rich pupils,\nalso,--perhaps begin with such altogether; then, when I've got a start,\nI can take a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich people's\nchildren often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've seen\nunfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones pushed\nforward, when it's real cruelty. Some are naughty through mismanagement\nor neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best have to get\nthrough the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they need most\npatience and kindness. People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try\nto keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn, all at once, from\npretty children into fine young men. They don't complain much,--plucky\nlittle souls,--but they feel it. I've been through something of it, and\nI know all about it. I've a special interest in such young bears, and\nlike to show them that I see the warm, honest, well-meaning boys'\nhearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy heads.\nI've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up one boy to be a pride\nand honor to his family?\"\n\n\"I'll testify that you tried to do it,\" said Laurie, with a grateful\nlook.\n\n\"And I've succeeded beyond my hopes; for here you are, a steady,\nsensible business man, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying\nup the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not merely\na business man: you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself,\nand let others go halves, as you always did in the old times. I _am_\nproud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and every one feels\nit, though you won't let them say so. Yes, and when I have my flock,\nI'll just point to you, and say, 'There's your model, my lads.'\"\n\nPoor Laurie didn't know where to look; for, man though he was, something\nof the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all\nfaces turn approvingly upon him.\n\n\"I say, Jo, that's rather too much,\" he began, just in his old boyish\nway. \"You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,\nexcept by doing my best not to disappoint you. You have rather cast me\noff lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless; so, if I've\ngot on at all, you may thank these two for it;\" and he laid one hand\ngently on his grandfather's white head, the other on Amy's golden one,\nfor the three were never far apart.\n\n\"I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the\nworld!\" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind\njust then. \"When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as the\nthree I know and love the best. If John and my Fritz were only here, it\nwould be quite a little heaven on earth,\" she added more quietly. And\nthat night, when she went to her room, after a blissful evening of\nfamily counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of happiness\nthat she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near\nher own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.\n\nIt was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen\nin an unusually rapid and delightful manner. Almost before she knew\nwhere she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield. Then a\nfamily of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished\nsurprisingly, poor boys as well as rich; for Mr. Laurence was\ncontinually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the\nBhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for\nits support. In this way the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo, and\nfurnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.\n\nOf course it was up-hill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes; but\nthe wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most\nrampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her\n\"wilderness of boys,\" and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented\nhad she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered\nPlumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harry\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PLUMFIELD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plumfield is a school established by Professor Bhaer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
