But the instant she vanished, Meg began to\nsidle towards the door, murmuring,--\n\n\"Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her.\"\n\n\"Don't go; are you afraid of me, Margaret?\" and Mr. Brooke looked so\nhurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude. She\nblushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called\nher Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet\nit seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her\nease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said\ngratefully,--\n\n\"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to father? I only wish I\ncould thank you for it.\"\n\n                 [Illustration: Shall I tell you how?]\n\n\"Shall I tell you how?\" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in\nboth his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown\neyes, that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away\nand to stop and listen.\n\n\"Oh no, please don't--I'd rather not,\" she said, trying to withdraw her\nhand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.\n\n\"I won't trouble you, I only want to know if you care for me a little,\nMeg. I love you so much, dear,\" added Mr. Brooke tenderly.\n\nThis was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make it;\nshe forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, \"I don't\nknow,\" so softly, that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish\nlittle reply.\n\nHe seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as\nif quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said, in his\nmost persuasive tone, \"Will you try and find out? I want to know _so_\nmuch; for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am\nto have my reward in the end or not.\"\n\n\"I'm too young,\" faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet\nrather enjoying it.\n\n\"I'll wait; and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me. Would\nit be a very hard lesson, dear?\"\n\n\"Not if I chose to learn it, but--\"\n\n\"Please choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is easier than\nGerman,\" broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that\nshe had no way of hiding her face, as he bent to look into it.\n\nHis tone was properly beseeching; but, stealing a shy look at him, Meg\nsaw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the\nsatisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. This nettled\nher; Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and\nthe love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little\nwomen, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt\nexcited and strange, and, not knowing what else to do, followed a\ncapricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, \"I\n_don't_ choose. Please go away and let me be!\"\n\nPoor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling\nabout his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it\nrather bewildered him.\n\n\"Do you really mean that?\" he asked anxiously, following her as she\nwalked away.\n\n\"Yes, I do; I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says I\nneedn't; it's too soon and I'd rather not.\"\n\n\"Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by and by? I'll wait, and say\nnothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, Meg. I didn't\nthink that of you.\"\n\n\"Don't think of me at all. I'd rather you wouldn't,\" said Meg, taking a\nnaughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and her own power.\n\nHe was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel\nheroes whom she admired; but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped\nabout the room, as they did; he just stood looking at her so wistfully,\nso tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of her. What\nwould have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come\nhobbling in at this interesting minute.\n\nThe old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew; for she had\nmet Laurie as she took her airing, and, hearing of Mr. March's arrival,\ndrove straight out to see him. The family were all busy in the back part\nof the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise\nthem. She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she\nhad seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.\n\n\"Bless me, what's all this?\" cried the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MR.
