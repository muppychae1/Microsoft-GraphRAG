Don't laugh at the\nspinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragical romances are\nhidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,\nand many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make\nthe faded faces beautiful in God's sight. Even the sad, sour sisters\nshould be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part\nof life, if for no other reason; and, looking at them with compassion,\nnot contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too may\nmiss the blossom time; that rosy cheeks don't last forever, that silver\nthreads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that, by and by,\nkindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now.\n\nGentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter\nhow poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that\nwhich is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,\nand serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect\nthe good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and\npetted, too often without thanks; the scrapes they have helped you out\nof, the \"tips\" they have given you from their small store, the stitches\nthe patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet\nhave taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions\nthat women love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls\nare quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them;\nand if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son,\nshould rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and\nmaternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has kept the warmest\ncorner of her lonely old heart for the \"the best nevvy in the world.\"\n\nJo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this\nlittle homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand before\nher,--a substantial, lifelike ghost,--leaning over her, with the very\nlook he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't like to show\nit. But, like Jenny in the ballad,--\n\n        \"She could not think it he,\"\n\nand lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and\nkissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully,--\n\n\"O my Teddy! O my Teddy!\"\n\n\"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?\"\n\n\"Glad! My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy?\"\n\n\"Your mother has got her down at Meg's. We stopped there by the way, and\nthere was no getting my wife out of their clutches.\"\n\n\"Your what?\" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an\nunconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.\n\n\"Oh, the dickens! now I've done it;\" and he looked so guilty that Jo was\ndown upon him like a flash.\n\n\"You've gone and got married!\"\n\n\"Yes, please, but I never will again;\" and he went down upon his knees,\nwith a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth,\nand triumph.\n\n\"Actually married?\"\n\n\"Very much so, thank you.\"\n\n\"Mercy on us! What dreadful thing will you do next?\" and Jo fell into\nher seat, with a gasp.\n\n\"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,\"\nreturned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like\na burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you\nridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to\nbarricade.\"\n\nJo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted\nthe sofa invitingly, as she said, in a cordial tone,--\n\n\"The old pillow is up garret, and we don't need it now; so, come and\n'fess, Teddy.\"\n\n\"How good it sounds to hear you say 'Teddy'! No one ever calls me that\nbut you;\" and Laurie sat down, with an air of great content.\n\n\"What does Amy call you?\"\n\n\"My lord.\"\n\n\"That's like her. Well, you look it;\" and Jo's eyes plainly betrayed\nthat she found her boy comelier than ever.\n\nThe pillow was gone, but there _was_ a barricade, nevertheless,--a\nnatural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it,\nand for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast\na little shadow over them. It was gone directly, however, for Laurie\nsaid, with a vain attempt at dignity,--\n\n\"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?\"\n\n\"Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier, but you\nare the same scapegrace as ever.\"\n\n\"Now, really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,\" began\nL\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUNT PRISCILLA<|>PERSON<|>Aunt Priscilla is mentioned as a maternal figure who cherishes her nephew)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNY<|>PERSON<|>Jenny is mentioned in a ballad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character who interacts with Laurie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character who interacts with Jo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is mentioned as Laurie's wife)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is mentioned as a location where Laurie's mother and Amy are)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>AMY<|>Laurie is married to Amy<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>JO<|>Laurie interacts with Jo<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>LAURIE<|>Jo interacts with Laurie<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>MEG<|>Laurie's mother and Amy are at Meg's location<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>AUNT PRISCILLA<|>Jo mentions Aunt Priscilla as a maternal figure<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
