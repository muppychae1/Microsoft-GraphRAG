Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady who\nwas third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole family\nwith great respect; for, in spite of her American birth and breeding,\nshe possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of\nus,--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set\nthe most democratic nation under the sun in a ferment at the coming of a\nroyal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has\nsomething to do with the love the young country bears the old, like that\nof a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she\ncould, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. But\neven the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the\nBritish nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time; and when the\nproper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from\nthis aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping\nthat her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which\nshould bring disgrace upon the name of March.\n\n                [Illustration: It might have been worse]\n\nIt might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad; for Jo sat on the\ngrass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog\nreposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related\none of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience. One small child was\npoking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating\ngingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her\ngloves. But all were enjoying themselves; and when Jo collected her\ndamaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come\nagain, \"it was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks.\"\n\n\"Capital boys, aren't they? I feel quite young and brisk again after\nthat,\" said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from\nhabit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.\n\n\"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?\" asked Amy, wisely refraining from\nany comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.\n\n\"Don't like him; he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his father,\nand doesn't speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie says he is fast,\nand _I_ don't consider him a desirable acquaintance; so I let him\nalone.\"\n\n\"You might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool nod; and\njust now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,\nwhose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just reversed the nod and\nthe bow, it would have been right,\" said Amy reprovingly.\n\n\"No, it wouldn't,\" returned perverse Jo; \"I neither like, respect, nor\nadmire Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece _was_\nthird cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very\nclever; I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he _is_ a\ngentleman in spite of the brown-paper parcels.\"\n\n\"It's no use trying to argue with you,\" began Amy.\n\n\"Not the least, my dear,\" interrupted Jo; \"so let us look amiable, and\ndrop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I'm deeply\ngrateful.\"\n\nThe family card-case having done its duty, the girls walked on, and Jo\nuttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being told\nthat the young ladies were engaged.\n\n\"Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March to-day. We can run down\nthere any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the dust in our\nbest bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt likes to have us pay her the\ncompliment of coming in style, and making a formal call; it's a little\nthing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don't believe it will hurt\nyour things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil\nthem. Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet.\"\n\n\"What a good girl you are, Amy!\" said Jo, with a repentant glance from\nher own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and\nspotless still. \"I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to\nplease people as it is for you. I think of them, but it takes too much\ntime to do them; so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and let\nthe small ones slip; but they tell best in the end, I fancy.\"\n\nAmy smiled, and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,--\n\n\"Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones; for they\nhave no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive.
