Poor dear, just wait till I make\nmy fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice-cream and\nhigh-heeled slippers and posies and red-headed boys to dance with.\"\n\n\"How ridiculous you are, Jo!\" but Meg laughed at the nonsense, and felt\nbetter in spite of herself.\n\n\"Lucky for you I am; for if I put on crushed airs, and tried to be\ndismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can\nalways find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any more, but\ncome home jolly, there's a dear.\"\n\nJo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for\nthe day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm\nturn-over, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,\nhard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.\n\nWhen Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate\nfriend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward\ntheir own support, at least. Believing that they could not begin too\nearly to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents\nconsented, and both fell to work with the hearty good-will which in\nspite of all obstacles, is sure to succeed at last. Margaret found a\nplace as nursery governess, and felt rich with her small salary. As she\nsaid, she _was_ \"fond of luxury,\" and her chief trouble was poverty. She\nfound it harder to bear than the others, because she could remember a\ntime when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want\nof any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it\nwas very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay\nfriends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw\nall she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg\ncaught frequent glimpses of dainty ball-dresses and bouquets, heard\nlively gossip about theatres, concerts, sleighing parties, and\nmerry-makings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which\nwould have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a\nsense of injustice made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes, for\nshe had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which\nalone can make life happy.\n\nJo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame, and needed an active\nperson to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one\nof the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her\noffer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost\nall chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will; but the\nunworldly Marches only said,--\n\n\"We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will\nkeep together and be happy in one another.\"\n\nThe old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo\nat a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck\nthe old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This\ndid not suit Jo at all; but she accepted the place since nothing better\nappeared, and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well with her\nirascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo had\nmarched home, declaring she couldn't bear it any longer; but Aunt March\nalways cleared up quickly, and sent for her back again with such urgency\nthat she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery\nold lady.\n\nI suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,\nwhich was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered\nthe kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges\nwith his big dictionaries, tell her stories about the queer pictures in\nhis Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in\nthe street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the\ntall book-cases, the cosy chairs, the globes, and, best of all, the\nwilderness of books, in which she could wander where she liked, made the\nlibrary a region of bliss to her. The moment Aunt March took her nap, or\nwas busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and, curling\nherself up in the easy-chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,\ntravels, and pictures, like a regular book-worm. But, like all\nhappiness, it did\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
