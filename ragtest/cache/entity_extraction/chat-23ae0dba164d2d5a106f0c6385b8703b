The walk revived her spirits; and, flattering herself that\nshe had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a very\nyoung lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid\nstrawberries. By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived, and\nthe stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had\nworked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and\nforgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when\nthe door flew open, and a floury, crocky, flushed, and dishevelled\nfigure appeared, demanding tartly,--\n\n\"I say, isn't bread 'riz' enough when it runs over the pans?\"\n\nSallie began to laugh; but Meg nodded, and lifted her eyebrows as high\nas they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish, and put the\nsour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March went out,\nafter peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a word\nof comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding-sheet, while the dear\ndeparted lay in state in the domino-box. A strange sense of helplessness\nfell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner; and\ndespair seized them, when, a few minutes later, Miss Crocker appeared,\nand said she'd come to dinner. Now, this lady was a thin, yellow\nspinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything,\nand gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had been taught\nto be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor, and had few\nfriends. So Meg gave her the easy-chair, and tried to entertain her,\nwhile she asked questions, criticised everything, and told stories of\nthe people whom she knew.\n\nLanguage cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which\nJo underwent that morning; and the dinner she served up became a\nstanding joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,\nand discovered that something more than energy and good-will is\nnecessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus for an hour, and was\ngrieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.\nThe bread burnt black; for the salad-dressing so aggravated her, that\nshe let everything else go till she had convinced herself that she could\nnot make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but\nshe hammered and poked, till it was unshelled, and its meagre\nproportions concealed in a grove of lettuce-leaves. The potatoes had to\nbe hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at\nlast. The blanc-mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as\nthey looked, having been skilfully \"deaconed.\"\n\n\"Well, they can eat beef, and bread and butter, if they are hungry; only\nit's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,\"\nthought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and\nstood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread for\nLaurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose\ncurious eyes would mark all failures, and whose tattling tongue would\nreport them far and wide.\n\nPoor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after\nanother was tasted and left; while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,\nMiss Crocker pursed up her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all\nhis might, to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo's one strong\npoint was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a pitcher of\nrich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew\na long breath, as the pretty glass plates went round, and every one\nlooked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream.\nMiss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water\nhastily. Jo, who had refused, thinking there might not be enough, for\nthey dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he\nwas eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his\nmouth, and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of\ndelicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her\nnapkin, and left the table precipitately.\n\n              [Illustration: Miss Crocker made a wry face]\n\n\"Oh, what is it?\" exclaimed Jo trembling.\n\n\"Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,\" replied Meg, with a\ntragic gesture.\n\nJo uttered a groan, and fell back in her chair; remembering that she had\ngiven a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes\non the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the\nrefrigerator. She turned scarlet, and was on the verge of crying, when\nshe met Laurie's eyes, which _would_ look merry in spite of his heroic\nefforts; the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she\nlaughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did every one else, even\n\"Croaker,\" as the girls called the old lady; and the unfortunate dinner\nended gayly, with bread and butter, olives and fun.\n\n\"I\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
