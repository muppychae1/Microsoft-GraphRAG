Returning from one of Mozart's grand operas,\nsplendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own,\nplayed a few of the best parts, sat staring up at the busts of\nMendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again; then\nsuddenly he tore up his music-sheets, one by one, and, as the last\nfluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself,--\n\n\"She is right! Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so. That\nmusic has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I\nwon't be a humbug any longer. Now what shall I do?\"\n\nThat seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had\nto work for his daily bread. Now, if ever, occurred an eligible\nopportunity for \"going to the devil,\" as he once forcibly expressed it,\nfor he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially\nfond of providing employment for full and idle hands. The poor fellow\nhad temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood\nthem pretty well; for, much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith\nand confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire\nto be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,\nand say \"All's well,\" kept him safe and steady.\n\nVery likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, \"I don't believe it; boys\nwill be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not\nexpect miracles.\" I dare say _you_ don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true\nnevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion\nthat they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by\nrefusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys be boys, the longer the\nbetter, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must; but\nmothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one, and\nkeep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and showing\nthat they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which\nmake men manliest in good women's eyes. If it _is_ a feminine delusion,\nleave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the beauty and\nthe romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter\nall our hopes of the brave, tender-hearted little lads, who still love\ntheir mothers better than themselves, and are not ashamed to own it.\n\nLaurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb\nall his powers for years; but, to his great surprise, he discovered it\ngrew easier every day. He refused to believe it at first, got angry with\nhimself, and couldn't understand it; but these hearts of ours are\ncurious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in\nspite of us. Laurie's heart _wouldn't_ ache; the wound persisted in\nhealing with a rapidity that astonished him, and, instead of trying to\nforget, he found himself trying to remember. He had not foreseen this\nturn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. He was disgusted with\nhimself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture of\ndisappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous\nblow so soon. He carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love, but\nthey refused to burst into a blaze: there was only a comfortable glow\nthat warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever, and he\nwas reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly\nsubsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very tender, a little sad and\nresentful still, but that was sure to pass away in time, leaving a\nbrotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end.\n\nAs the word \"brotherly\" passed through his mind in one of these\nreveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was\nbefore him:--\n\n\"Well, he was a great man; and when he couldn't have one sister he took\nthe other, and was happy.\"\n\nLaurie did not utter the words, but he thought them; and the next\ninstant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself,--\n\n\"No, I won't! I haven't forgotten, I never can. I'll try again, and if\nthat fails, why, then--\"\n\nLeaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to\nJo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the\nleast hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't she, and let\nhim come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he did nothing,\nbut he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience. It\ncame at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo\ndecidedly couldn't and wouldn't. She was wrapped up in Beth, and never\nwished to hear the word \"love\" again. Then she begged him to be happy\nwith somebody else, but always to keep a little corner of his heart for\nhis loving sister Jo. In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy\nthat Beth was worse; she was coming home in the spring, and there was no\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MOZART<|>PERSON<|>Mozart was a great composer and musician)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENDELSSOHN<|>PERSON<|>Mendelssohn was a renowned composer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEETHOVEN<|>PERSON<|>Beethoven was a famous composer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BACH<|>PERSON<|>Bach was a legendary composer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character who struggled with love and self-discovery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SATAN<|>PERSON<|>Satan is a metaphorical figure representing temptation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
