A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo,\nas she thought, \"Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.\"\n\nShe was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great\nchange seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the look of pain\nwere gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in\nits utter repose, that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. Leaning\nlow over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp forehead with\nher heart on her lips, and softly whispered, \"Good-by, my Beth;\ngood-by!\"\n\nAs if waked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the\nbed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and then,\nthrowing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro,\nexclaiming, under her breath, \"The fever's turned; she's sleepin'\nnat'ral; her skin's damp, and she breathes easy. Praise be given! Oh, my\ngoodness me!\"\n\nBefore the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to\nconfirm it. He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite\nheavenly when he smiled, and said, with a fatherly look at them, \"Yes,\nmy dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time. Keep the\nhouse quiet; let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her--\"\n\nWhat they were to give, neither heard; for both crept into the dark\nhall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with\nhearts too full for words. When they went back to be kissed and cuddled\nby faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do, with her\ncheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing\nquietly, as if just fallen asleep.\n\n\"If mother would only come now!\" said Jo, as the winter night began to\nwane.\n\n\"See,\" said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, \"I thought\nthis would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand to-morrow if she--went\naway from us. But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put\nit in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she\nsees will be the little rose, and mother's face.\"\n\nNever had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed\nso lovely, as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out\nin the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.\n\n\"It looks like a fairy world,\" said Meg, smiling to herself, as she\nstood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.\n\n\"Hark!\" cried Jo, starting to her feet.\n\nYes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah,\nand then Laurie's voice saying, in a joyful whisper, \"Girls, she's come!\nshe's come!\"\n\n\n\n\n                       [Illustration: Amy's Will]\n\n                                  XIX.\n\n                              AMY'S WILL.\n\n\nWhile these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at\nAunt March's. She felt her exile deeply, and, for the first time in her\nlife, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March\nnever petted any one; she did not approve of it; but she meant to be\nkind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt\nMarch had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children,\nthough she didn't think proper to confess it. She really did her best to\nmake Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made! Some old people\nkeep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize\nwith children's little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can\nhide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship\nin the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried\nAmy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy\ntalks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the\nold lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the\nbad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy in hand, and\ntaught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago,--a process\nwhich carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made her feel like a fly in the\nweb of a very strict spider.\n\n     [Illustration: Polish up the spoons and the fat silver teapot]\n\nShe had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned\nspoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses, till they shone. Then\nshe must dust the room, and what a trying job that was! Not a speck\nescaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs, and much\ncarving, which was never dusted to suit. Then Polly must be fed, the\nlap-dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down, to get things, or\ndeliver orders, for the old lady was very lame, and seldom left her big\nchair.
