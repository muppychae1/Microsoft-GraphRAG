Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her\nmind; for, after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced\nround on her, speaking so abruptly that \"Rasselas\" tumbled face downward\non the floor.\n\n\"What has that boy been about? Don't try to shield him. I know he has\nbeen in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. I can't get a\nword from him; and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he\nbolted upstairs, and locked himself into his room.\"\n\n\"He did do wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word\nto any one,\" began Jo reluctantly.\n\n\"That won't do; he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you\nsoft-hearted girls. If he's done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg\npardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo, I won't be kept in the dark.\"\n\nMr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have\ngladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps,\nand he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and\nbrave it out.\n\n     [Illustration: He stood at the foot, like a lion in the path]\n\n\"Indeed, sir, I cannot tell; mother forbade it. Laurie has confessed,\nasked pardon, and been punished quite enough. We don't keep silence to\nshield him, but some one else, and it will make more trouble if you\ninterfere. Please don't; it was partly my fault, but it's all right now;\nso let's forget it, and talk about the 'Rambler,' or something\npleasant.\"\n\n\"Hang the 'Rambler!' come down and give me your word that this\nharum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or impertinent.\nIf he has, after all your kindness to him, I'll thrash him with my own\nhands.\"\n\nThe threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the\nirascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson,\nwhatever he might say to the contrary. She obediently descended, and\nmade as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or\nforgetting the truth.\n\n\"Hum--ha--well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and not\nfrom obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn fellow, and hard to\nmanage,\" said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he\nhad been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with an\nair of relief.\n\n\"So am I; but a kind word will govern me when all the king's horses and\nall the king's men couldn't,\" said Jo, trying to say a kind word for her\nfriend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another.\n\n\"You think I'm not kind to him, hey?\" was the sharp answer.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no, sir; you are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a\ntrifle hasty when he tries your patience. Don't you think you are?\"\n\nJo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,\nthough she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief\nand surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles on to the\ntable with a rattle, and exclaimed frankly,--\n\n\"You're right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my patience past\nbearing, and I don't know how it will end, if we go on so.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, he'll run away.\" Jo was sorry for that speech the\nminute it was made; she meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear\nmuch restraint, and hoped he would be more forbearing with the lad.\n\nMr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a\ntroubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his\ntable. It was Laurie's father, who _had_ run away in his youth, and\nmarried against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he remembered\nand regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.\n\n\"He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it\nsometimes, when he gets tired of studying. I often think I should like\nto, especially since my hair was cut; so, if you ever miss us, you may\nadvertise for two boys, and look among the ships bound for India.\"\n\nShe laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently\ntaking the whole as a joke.\n\n\"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where's your respect for me,\nand your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What torments\nthey are; yet we can't do without them,\" he said, pinching her cheeks\ngood-humoredly. \"Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it's\nall right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his\ngrandfather. I won't bear it.\"\n\n\"He won't come, sir; he feels badly because you didn't believe him when\nhe said he couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his feelings very\nmuch.\"\n\nJo tried to look pathetic, but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began\nto laugh\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
