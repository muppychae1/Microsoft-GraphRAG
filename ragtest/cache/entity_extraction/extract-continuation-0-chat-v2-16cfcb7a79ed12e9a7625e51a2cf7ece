This was\nsomething altogether new, and it proved a grand success; for Mrs. March\ncouldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands with every\none of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little\nquadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.\n\nAfter this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and\nher daughters under the festival tree.\n\n[Illustration: \"Leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival\n                           tree.\"--Page 583]\n\n\"I don't think I ever ought to call myself 'Unlucky Jo' again, when my\ngreatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,\" said Mrs. Bhaer,\ntaking Teddy's little fist out of the milk-pitcher, in which he was\nrapturously churning.\n\n\"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long\nago. Do you remember our castles in the air?\" asked Amy, smiling as she\nwatched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.\n\n\"Dear fellows! It does my heart good to see them forget business, and\nfrolic for a day,\" answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all\nmankind. \"Yes, I remember; but the life I wanted then seems selfish,\nlonely, and cold to me now. I haven't given up the hope that I may write\na good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it will be all the better\nfor such experiences and illustrations as these;\" and Jo pointed from\nthe lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the\nProfessor's arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one\nof the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother,\nsitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in her lap\nand at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face which\nnever could grow old to them.\n\n\"My castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for splendid\nthings, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I\nhad a little home, and John, and some dear children like these. I've got\nthem all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world;\" and Meg\nlaid her hand on her tall boy's head, with a face full of tender and\ndevout content.\n\n\"My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter\nit, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic hopes, or\nconfine myself to helping others fulfil their dreams of beauty. I've\nbegun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing\nI've ever done. I think so myself, and mean to do it in marble, so that,\nwhatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little angel.\"\n\nAs Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping\nchild in her arms; for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little\ncreature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy's sunshine.\nThis cross was doing much for both father and mother, for one love and\nsorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature was growing sweeter,\ndeeper, and more tender; Laurie was growing more serious, strong, and\nfirm; and both were learning that beauty, youth, good fortune, even love\nitself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blest;\nfor--\n\n        \"Into each life some rain must fall,\n         Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.\"\n\n\"She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear. Don't despond, but\nhope and keep happy,\" said Mrs. March, as tender-hearted Daisy stooped\nfrom her knee, to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin's pale\none.\n\n\"I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie\nto take more than half of every burden,\" replied Amy warmly. \"He never\nlets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so devoted\nto Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always, that I can't love him\nenough. So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg, 'Thank God,\nI'm a happy woman.'\"\n\n\"There's no need for me to say it, for every one can see that I'm far\nhappier than I deserve,\" added Jo, glancing from her good husband to her\nchubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her. \"Fritz is getting\ngray and stout; I'm growing as thin as a shadow, and am thirty; we never\nshall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night, for that\nincorrigible Tommy Bangs _will_ smoke sweet-fern cigars under the\nbed-clothes, though he's set himself afire three times already. But in\nspite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of, and\nnever was so jolly in my life. Excuse the remark, but living among boys,\nI can't help using their expressions now and then.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,\" began Mrs. March,\nfrightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of\ncountenance.\n\n\"Not half so good as yours, mother. Here it is, and we never can thank\nyou enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done,\" cried Jo,\nwith the loving impetuosity which she never could\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
