Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,--not a\nlovely one; for, with a bang, an ugly black imp appeared, and, having\ncroaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo, and disappeared with a\nmocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his\nboots, Hugo departed; and Hagar informed the audience that, as he had\nkilled a few of her friends in times past, she has cursed him, and\nintends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain\nfell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits\nof the play.\n\nA good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again; but when\nit became evident what a masterpiece of stage-carpentering had been got\nup, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb! A tower rose to\nthe ceiling; half-way up appeared a window, with a lamp burning at it,\nand behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver\ndress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap,\nred cloak, chestnut love-locks, a guitar, and the boots, of course.\nKneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones.\nZara replied, and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. Then came\nthe grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope-ladder, with five\nsteps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she\ncrept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo's shoulder, and was\nabout to leap gracefully down, when, \"Alas! alas for Zara!\" she forgot\nher train,--it caught in the window; the tower tottered, leaned forward,\nfell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins!\n\nA universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the\nwreck, and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \"I told you so! I told you\nso!\" With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed\nin, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside,--\n\n\"Don't laugh! Act as if it was all right!\"--and, ordering Roderigo up,\nbanished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly\nshaken by the fall of the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old\ngentleman, and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara: she\nalso defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons\nof the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains, and led them\naway, looking very much frightened, and evidently forgetting the speech\nhe ought to have made.\n\nAct third was the castle hall; and here Hagar appeared, having come to\nfree the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming, and hides; sees\nhim put the potions into two cups of wine, and bid the timid little\nservant \"Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall\ncome anon.\" The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and\nHagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando,\nthe \"minion,\" carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds\nthe poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long\nwarble, drinks it, loses his wits, and, after a good deal of clutching\nand stamping, falls flat and dies; while Hagar informs him what she has\ndone in a song of exquisite power and melody.\n\nThis was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought\nthat the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather marred\nthe effect of the villain's death. He was called before the curtain, and\nwith great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was\nconsidered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put\ntogether.\n\nAct fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing\nhimself, because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as\nthe dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,\ninforming him that Zara is true, but in danger, and he can save her, if\nhe will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of\nrapture he tears off his chains, and rushes away to find and rescue his\nlady-love.\n\nAct fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He\nwishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it; and, after a\ntouching appeal, is about to faint, when Roderigo dashes in and demands\nher hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and\ngesticulate tremendously, but cannot agree, and Roderigo is about to\nbear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a\nletter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The\nlatter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young\npair, and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy. The\nbag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
