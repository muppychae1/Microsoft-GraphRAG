The girls\nflew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg\narranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,\noverturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and\nfro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave\ndirections to every one, as she sat with her hands folded.\n\nAs they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly\nhappy face, \"I've got a treat for you after supper.\"\n\nA quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped\nher hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her\nnapkin, crying, \"A letter! a letter! Three cheers for father!\"\n\n\"Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through\nthe cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving\nwishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.\nMarch, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\n\n\"Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger, and simper\nover your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking in her tea, and dropping her\nbread, butter side down, on the carpet, in her haste to get at the\ntreat.\n\nBeth ate no more, but crept away, to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\nover the delight to come, till the others were ready.\n\n\"I think it was so splendid in father to go as a chaplain when he was\ntoo old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg\nwarmly.\n\n\"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a _vivan_--what's its name? or a\nnurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\n\n\"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\nbad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.\n\n\"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\nher voice.\n\n\"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his\nwork faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a\nminute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.\"\n\nThey all drew to the fire, mother in the big chair with Beth at her\nfeet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\nthe back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\nshould happen to be touching.\n\nVery few letters were written in those hard times that were not\ntouching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little\nwas said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the\nhomesickness conquered; it was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of\nlively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news; and only\nat the end did the writer's heart overflow with fatherly love and\nlonging for the little girls at home.\n\n           [Illustration: It was a cheerful, hopeful letter]\n\n\"Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by\nday, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection\nat all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but\nremind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days\nneed not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that\nthey will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully,\nfight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so\nbeautifully, that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder\nthan ever of my little women.\"\n\nEverybody sniffed when they came to that part; Jo wasn't ashamed of the\ngreat tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded\nthe rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother's shoulder\nand sobbed out, \"I _am_ a selfish girl! but I'll truly try to be better,\nso he mayn't be disappointed in me by and by.\"\n\n\"We all will!\" cried Meg. \"I think too much of my looks, and hate to\nwork, but won't any more, if I can help it.\"\n\n\"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman,' and not be\nrough and wild; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\nelse,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\nharder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\n\nBeth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army-sock, and\nbegan to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\nlay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\nthat father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\ncoming home.\n\n        [Illustration: How you used to play Pilgrim's Progress]\n\nMrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her\ncheery voice, \"Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim's Progress\nwhen you were little things?
