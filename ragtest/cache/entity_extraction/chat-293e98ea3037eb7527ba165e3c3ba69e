But it does\nseem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and\ndrive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's like other people,\nyou know, and I always envy girls who do such things; I'm so fond of\nluxury,\" said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the\nleast shabby.\n\n\"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble, but shoulder our\nbundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure Aunt\nMarch is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've\nlearned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so\nlight that I sha'n't mind her.\"\n\nThis idea tickled Jo's fancy, and put her in good spirits; but Meg\ndidn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoilt children,\nseemed heavier than ever. She hadn't heart enough even to make herself\npretty, as usual, by putting on a blue neck-ribbon, and dressing her\nhair in the most becoming way.\n\n\"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross\nmidgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?\" she muttered,\nshutting her drawer with a jerk. \"I shall have to toil and moil all my\ndays, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly\nand sour, because I'm poor, and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.\nIt's a shame!\"\n\nSo Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable\nat breakfast-time. Every one seemed rather out of sorts, and inclined to\ncroak. Beth had a headache, and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort\nherself with the cat and three kittens; Amy was fretting because her\nlessons were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers; Jo _would_\nwhistle and make a great racket getting ready; Mrs. March was very busy\ntrying to finish a letter, which must go at once; and Hannah had the\ngrumps, for being up late didn't suit her.\n\n\"There never _was_ such a cross family!\" cried Jo, losing her temper\nwhen she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot-lacings, and sat down\nupon her hat.\n\n\"You're the crossest person in it!\" returned Amy, washing out the sum,\nthat was all wrong, with the tears that had fallen on her slate.\n\n\"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them\ndrowned,\" exclaimed Meg angrily, as she tried to get rid of the kitten,\nwhich had scrambled up her back, and stuck like a burr just out of\nreach.\n\nJo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed, because she\ncouldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.\n\n\"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I _must_ get this off by the\nearly mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,\" cried Mrs.\nMarch, crossing out the third spoilt sentence in her letter.\n\nThere was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two\nhot turn-overs on the table, and stalked out again. These turn-overs\nwere an institution; and the girls called them \"muffs,\" for they had no\nothers, and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold\nmornings. Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy\nshe might be, for the walk was long and bleak; the poor things got no\nother lunch, and were seldom home before two.\n\n\"Cuddle your cats, and get over your headache, Bethy. Good-by, Marmee;\nwe are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home regular\nangels. Now then, Meg!\" and Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims\nwere not setting out as they ought to do.\n\nThey always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was\nalways at the window, to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.\nSomehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without\nthat; for, whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that\nmotherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.\n\n\"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would\nserve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never\nseen,\" cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and\nbitter wind.\n\n\"Don't use such dreadful expressions,\" said Meg, from the depths of the\nvail in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.\n\n\"I\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
