She could have bitten her tongue out the\nminute she had said it, for John pushed the books away, and got up,\nsaying, with a little quiver in his voice, \"I was afraid of this; I do\nmy best, Meg.\" If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not\nhave broken her heart like those few words. She ran to him and held him\nclose, crying, with repentant tears, \"O John, my dear, kind,\nhard-working boy, I didn't mean it! It was so wicked, so untrue and\nungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!\"\n\nHe was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach;\nbut Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be\nforgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again. She had\npromised to love him for better for worse; and then she, his wife, had\nreproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings recklessly.\nIt was dreadful; and the worst of it was John went on so quietly\nafterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he stayed in\ntown later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to\nsleep. A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick; and the discovery that\nJohn had countermanded the order for his new great-coat reduced her to a\nstate of despair which was pathetic to behold. He had simply said, in\nanswer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, \"I can't afford it,\nmy dear.\"\n\nMeg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall, with\nher face buried in the old great-coat, crying as if her heart would\nbreak.\n\nThey had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband\nbetter for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,\ngiven him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him\na tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings\nand failures of those he loved.\n\nNext day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the\ntruth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor. The good-natured Mrs.\nMoffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present\nof it immediately afterward. Then Meg ordered home the great-coat, and,\nwhen John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new\nsilk gown. One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his\npresent, and what a blissful state of things ensued. John came home\nearly, Meg gadded no more; and that great-coat was put on in the morning\nby a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted little\nwife. So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to Meg a new\nexperience,--the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.\n\nLaurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dove-cote, one Saturday,\nwith an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals; for\nHannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the\nother.\n\n\"How's the little mamma? Where is everybody? Why didn't you tell me\nbefore I came home?\" began Laurie, in a loud whisper.\n\n\"Happy as a queen, the dear! Every soul of 'em is upstairs a worshipin';\nwe didn't want no hurrycanes round. Now you go into the parlor, and I'll\nsend 'em down to you,\" with which somewhat involved reply Hannah\nvanished, chuckling ecstatically.\n\nPresently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon\na large pillow. Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes twinkled, and\nthere was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort.\n\n\"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,\" she said invitingly.\n\nLaurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him\nwith an imploring gesture: \"No, thank you, I'd rather not. I shall drop\nit or smash it, as sure as fate.\"\n\n\"Then you sha'n't see your nevvy,\" said Jo decidedly, turning as if to\ngo.\n\n\"I will, I will! only you must be responsible for damages;\" and, obeying\norders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his\narms. A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah, and John\ncaused him to open them the next minute, to find himself invested with\ntwo babies instead of one.\n\n[Illustration: Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put\n                             into his arms]\n\nNo wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough\nto convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious\ninnocents to the hilarious spectators, with such dismay that Jo sat down\non the floor and screamed.\n\n\"Twins, by Jupiter!\" was all he said for a minute; then, turning to the\nwomen with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he added, \"Take\n'em quick, somebody! I'm going to laugh, and I shall drop 'em.\"\n\nJohn rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm,\nas if already initiated into the mysteries of baby-tending, while Laurie\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a woman who initially struggles with her feelings towards her husband John)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN<|>PERSON<|>John is Meg's husband who shows patience and strength despite challenges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALLIE<|>PERSON<|>Sallie is a friend of Meg who helps her in a time of need)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character who brings excitement and joy to the household)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANNAH<|>PERSON<|>Hannah is a household member who is excited about the events unfolding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
