In America, as every one\nknows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their\nfreedom with republican zest; but the young matrons usually abdicate\nwith the first heir to the throne, and go into a seclusion almost as\nclose as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet. Whether they\nlike it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the\nwedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim, as did a\nvery pretty woman the other day, \"I'm as handsome as ever, but no one\ntakes any notice of me because I'm married.\"\n\nNot being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience\nthis affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little world\nprimitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired and\nbeloved than ever.\n\nAs she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very\nstrong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter\nexclusion of everything and everybody else. Day and night she brooded\nover them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the tender\nmercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen\ndepartment. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely\nattentions he had been accustomed to receive; but, as he adored his\nbabies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time, supposing,\nwith masculine ignorance, that peace would soon be restored. But three\nmonths passed, and there was no return of repose; Meg looked worn and\nnervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the house was\nneglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life \"aisy,\" kept him on short\ncommons. When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small\ncommissions for the captive mamma; if he came gayly in at night, eager\nto embrace his family, he was quenched by a \"Hush! they are just asleep\nafter worrying all day.\" If he proposed a little amusement at home, \"No,\nit would disturb the babies.\" If he hinted at a lecture or concert, he\nwas answered with a reproachful look, and a decided \"Leave my children\nfor pleasure, never!\" His sleep was broken by infant wails and visions\nof a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the\nnight; his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the\npresiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp\nsounded from the nest above; and when he read his paper of an evening,\nDemi's colic got into the shipping-list, and Daisy's fall affected the\nprice of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news.\n\nThe poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of\nhis wife; home was merely a nursery, and the perpetual \"hushing\" made\nhim feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts\nof Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six months, and, when no\nsigns of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles\ndo,--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married and gone\nto housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running over\nfor an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his\nown wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. Mrs. Scott was a\nlively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable, and she\nperformed her mission most successfully. The parlor was always bright\nand attractive, the chess-board ready, the piano in tune, plenty of gay\ngossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.\n\nJohn would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely;\nbut as it was, he gratefully took the next best thing, and enjoyed his\nneighbor's society.\n\nMeg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a\nrelief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in the\nparlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children. But by and\nby, when the teething worry was over, and the idols went to sleep at\nproper hours, leaving mamma time to rest, she began to miss John, and\nfind her work-basket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite in\nhis old dressing-gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender.\nShe would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured because he did\nnot know that she wanted him without being told, entirely forgetting the\nmany evenings he had waited for her in vain. She was nervous and worn\nout with watching and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind\nwhich the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares\noppress them. Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much\ndevotion to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes them feel as\nif they were all nerve and no muscle.\n\n\"Yes,\" she would say, looking in the glass, \"I'm getting old and ugly;\nJohn doesn't find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded wife\nand goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances. Well, the\nbabies love me; they don't care if I am thin and pale, and haven't time\nto crimp my hair; they are my comfort, and some day John will see\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
