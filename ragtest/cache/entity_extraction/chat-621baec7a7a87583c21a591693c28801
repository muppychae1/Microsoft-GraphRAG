It's as soft and white as a\nwoman's, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best\ngloves, and pick flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven!\nso I'm glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal-rings on it, only\nthe little old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she was\nhere to help me!\"\n\n\"So do I!\"\n\nThe hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough in\nthe echo of her wish to suit even Amy. She glanced down at him with a\nnew thought in her mind; but he was lying with his hat half over his\nface, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth. She only saw his\nchest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and\nthe hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to hide\nsomething too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in a minute\nvarious hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in Amy's mind,\nand told her what her sister never had confided to her. She remembered\nthat Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo; she recalled the shadow on\nhis face just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the\nlittle old ring, which was no ornament to a handsome hand. Girls are\nquick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had fancied that\nperhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration, and now she\nwas sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and, when she spoke again, it was\nin a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to\nmake it so.\n\n\"I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie; and if you weren't\nthe sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very angry with me.\nBut we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't bear to think they\nshould be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps,\nthey would understand the change better than I do.\"\n\n\"I think they would,\" came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as\ntouching as a broken one.\n\n\"They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,\nwhen I should have been more kind and patient than ever. I never did\nlike that Miss Randal, and now I hate her!\" said artful Amy, wishing to\nbe sure of her facts this time.\n\n\"Hang Miss Randal!\" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look\nthat left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.\n\n\"I beg pardon; I thought--\" and there she paused diplomatically.\n\n\"No, you didn't; you knew perfectly well I never cared for any one but\nJo.\" Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face\naway as he spoke.\n\n\"I did think so; but as they never said anything about it, and you came\naway, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind to you? Why, I\nwas sure she loved you dearly.\"\n\n\"She _was_ kind, but not in the right way; and it's lucky for her she\ndidn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me. It's\nher fault, though, and you may tell her so.\"\n\nThe hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled\nAmy, for she did not know what balm to apply.\n\n\"I was wrong, I didn't know. I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I can't\nhelp wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear.\"\n\n\"Don't, that's her name for me!\" and Laurie put up his hand with a quick\ngesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind, half-reproachful\ntone. \"Wait till you've tried it yourself,\" he added, in a low voice, as\nhe pulled up the grass by the handful.\n\n\"I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved,\" said\nAmy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.\n\nNow, Laurie flattered himself that he _had_ borne it remarkably well,\nmaking no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live\nit down alone. Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for the\nfirst time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first\nfailure, and shut himself up in moody indifference. He felt as if\nsuddenly shaken out of a pensive dream, and found it impossible to go to\nsleep again. Presently he sat up, and asked slowly,--\n\n\"Do you think Jo would despise me as you do?\"\n\n\"Yes, if she saw you now. She hates lazy people. Why don't you do\nsomething splendid, and _make_ her love you?\"\n\n\"I did my best, but it was no use.\"\n\n\"Graduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought to have\ndone, for your grandfather's sake. It would have been shameful to fail\nafter spending so much time and money, when every one knew you _could_\ndo well.\"\n\n\"I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,\" began Laurie,\nleaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.\n\n\"No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and\nproved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set about\nanother task of some sort, you'd\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
