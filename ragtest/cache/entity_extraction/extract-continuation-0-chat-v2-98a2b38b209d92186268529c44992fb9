Hannah \"felt in her bones\" that it was going to be an\nunusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for\neverybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To\nbegin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them; then Beth\nfelt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's\ngift,--a soft crimson merino wrapper,--was borne in triumph to the\nwindow to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had\ndone their best to be worthy of the name, for, like elves, they had\nworked by night, and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden\nstood a stately snow-maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of\nfruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of new music in the other, a\nperfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas\ncarol issuing from her lips, on a pink paper streamer:--\n\n                         \"THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH.\n\n        \"God bless you, dear Queen Bess!\n          May nothing you dismay,\n         But health and peace and happiness\n          Be yours, this Christmas Day.\n\n        \"Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,\n          And flowers for her nose;\n         Here's music for her pianee,\n          An Afghan for her toes.\n\n        \"A portrait of Joanna, see,\n          By Raphael No. 2,\n         Who labored with great industry\n          To make it fair and true.\n\n        \"Accept a ribbon red, I beg,\n          For Madam Purrer's tail;\n         And ice-cream made by lovely Peg,--\n          A Mont Blanc in a pail.\n\n        \"Their dearest love my makers laid\n          Within my breast of snow:\n         Accept it, and the Alpine maid,\n          From Laurie and from Jo.\"\n\n                      [Illustration: The Jungfrau]\n\nHow Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring in\nthe gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented them!\n\n\"I'm so full of happiness, that, if father was only here, I couldn't\nhold one drop more,\" said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo\ncarried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to\nrefresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the \"Jungfrau\" had\nsent her.\n\n\"So am I,\" added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the\nlong-desired Undine and Sintram.\n\n\"I'm sure I am,\" echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the\nMadonna and Child, which her mother had given her, in a pretty frame.\n\n\"Of course I am!\" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first\nsilk dress; for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it.\n\n\"How can _I_ be otherwise?\" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went\nfrom her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her hand caressed\nthe brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which\nthe girls had just fastened on her breast.\n\nNow and then, in this work-a-day world, things do happen in the\ndelightful story-book fashion, and what a comfort that is. Half an hour\nafter every one had said they were so happy they could only hold one\ndrop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door, and popped his\nhead in very quietly. He might just as well have turned a somersault and\nuttered an Indian war-whoop; for his face was so full of suppressed\nexcitement and his voice so treacherously joyful, that every one jumped\nup, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, \"Here's another\nChristmas present for the March family.\"\n\nBefore the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away\nsomehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,\nleaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and\ncouldn't. Of course there was a general stampede; and for several\nminutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things\nwere done, and no one said a word. Mr. March became invisible in the\nembrace of four pairs of loving arms; Jo disgraced herself by nearly\nfainting away, and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china-closet; Mr.\nBrooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently\nexplained; and Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and, never\nstopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in the most\ntouching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held\nup her hand with a warning, \"Hush! remember Beth!\"\n\nBut it was too late; the study door flew open, the little red wrapper\nappeared on the threshold,--joy put strength into the feeble limbs,--and\nBeth ran straight into her father's arms. Never mind what happened just\nafter that; for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness\nof the past, and leaving only the sweetness of the present.\n\nIt was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight\nagain, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat\nturkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the\nkitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HANNAH<|>PERSON<|>Hannah is a character who felt in her bones that Christmas Day would be successful)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
