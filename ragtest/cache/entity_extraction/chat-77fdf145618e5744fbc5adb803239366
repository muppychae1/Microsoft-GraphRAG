When I lost sight of father's dear old face, I felt a\n    trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an\n    Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less,\n    hadn't diverted my mind; for I amused myself by dropping\n    gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their\n    mouths to roar.\n\n    \"Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared\n    up likewise, and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.\n\n    \"Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even\n    in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little\n    sky-parlor--all she had; but there is a stove in it, and a nice\n    table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I\n    like. A fine view and a church-tower opposite atone for the many\n    stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery,\n    where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs.\n    Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty\n    children,--rather spoilt, I fancy, but they took to me after\n    telling them 'The Seven Bad Pigs;' and I've no doubt I shall\n    make a model governess.\n\n    \"I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the\n    great table, and for the present I do, for I _am_ bashful,\n    though no one will believe it.\n\n    \"'Now, my dear, make yourself at home,' said Mrs. K. in her\n    motherly way; 'I'm on the drive from morning to night, as you\n    may suppose with such a family; but a great anxiety will be off\n    my mind if I know the children are safe with you. My rooms are\n    always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I\n    can make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you\n    feel sociable, and your evenings are always free. Come to me if\n    anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There's the\n    tea-bell; I must run and change my cap;' and off she bustled,\n    leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.\n\n    \"As I went downstairs, soon after, I saw something I liked. The\n    flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting\n    at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber\n    up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the heavy hod\n    of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at\n    a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a\n    foreign accent,--\n\n    \"'It goes better so. The little back is too young to haf such\n    heaviness.'\n\n    \"Wasn't it good of him? I like such things, for, as father says,\n    trifles show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that\n    evening, she laughed, and said,--\n\n    \"'That must have been Professor Bhaer; he's always doing things\n    of that sort.'\n\n    \"Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin; very learned and good, but\n    poor as a church-mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and\n    two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according\n    to the wishes of his sister, who married an American. Not a very\n    romantic story, but it interested me; and I was glad to hear\n    that Mrs. K. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars.\n    There is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to\n    peep at him, and then I'll tell you how he looks. He's almost\n    forty, so it's no harm, Marmee.\n\n    \"After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I\n    attacked the big work-basket, and had a quiet evening chatting\n    with my new friend. I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it\n    once a week; so good-night, and more to-morrow.\"\n\n                                                     \"_Tuesday Eve._\n\n    \"Had a lively time in my seminary, this morning, for the\n    children acted like Sancho; and at one time I really thought I\n    should shake them all round. Some good angel inspired me to try\n    gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and\n    keep still. After luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk,\n    and I went to my needle-work, like little Mabel, 'with a willing\n    mind.' I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to make nice\n    button-holes, when the parlor-door opened and shut, and some one\n    began to hum,--\n\n                         'Kennst du das land,'\n\n    like a big bumble-bee.
