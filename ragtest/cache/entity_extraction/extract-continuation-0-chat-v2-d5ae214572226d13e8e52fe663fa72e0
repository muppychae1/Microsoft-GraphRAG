My sister and friends have just come\nhome, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us.\"\n\nThough a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously\naway, and come again another day; but how could he, when Jo shut the\ndoor behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had\nsomething to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,\nand showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary\nman, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.\n\n\"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all. You\nhaf been ill, my friend?\"\n\nHe put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light\nfell on her face, and he saw a change in it.\n\n\"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you\nlast.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that;\" and he\nshook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no\ncomfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,\nwarm hand.\n\n\"Father, mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,\" she said, with a\nface and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as\nwell have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.\n\nIf the stranger had had any doubts about his reception, they were set at\nrest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Every one greeted\nhim kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for his\nown. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that opens all\nhearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once, feeling even the\nmore friendly because he was poor; for poverty enriches those who live\nabove it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer\nsat looking about him with the air of a traveller who knocks at a\nstrange door, and, when it opens, finds himself at home. The children\nwent to him like bees to a honey-pot; and, establishing themselves on\neach knee, proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets, pulling\nhis beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The\nwomen telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling\nthat he had got a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his\nguest's benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but\nsaid not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.\n\nIf Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have\namused her; for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like\nsuspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe\nthe new-comer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.\nHe got interested in spite of himself, and, before he knew it, was drawn\ninto the circle; for Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,\nand did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him\noften, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own\nlost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. Then his eye would\nturn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute\ninquiry if she had seen it; but Jo had her own eyes to take care of,\nand, feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on\nthe little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.\n\nA stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water\nafter a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious\nomens. Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded expression, and\nlooked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and\nhandsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she\nusually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite\ninspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the\nconversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic.\nJo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and\nthought to herself, as she watched her father's absorbed face, \"How he\nwould enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!\"\nLastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him\nlook more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and\nsmoothly brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for, in exciting\nmoments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do; and Jo liked\nit rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his\nfine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that\nplain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing\nescape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold\nsleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands!\n\n\"Dear old fellow!
