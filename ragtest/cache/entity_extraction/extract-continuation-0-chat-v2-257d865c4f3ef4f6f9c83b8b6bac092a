Nothing delighted you more than to have me\ntie my piece-bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks\nand rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the\ncellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the house-top,\nwhere you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a\nCelestial City.\"\n\n\"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and\npassing through the Valley where the hobgoblins were!\" said Jo.\n\n\"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs,\"\nsaid Meg.\n\n\"My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our\nflowers and arbors and pretty things were, and all stood and sung for\njoy up there in the sunshine,\" said Beth, smiling, as if that pleasant\nmoment had come back to her.\n\n\"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar\nand the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the\ntop. If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it\nover again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\nat the mature age of twelve.\n\n\"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\nplaying all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our\nroad is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\nguide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\nwhich is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\nbegin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get\nbefore father comes home.\"\n\n\"Really, mother? Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very\nliteral young lady.\n\n\"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth; I rather\nthink she hasn't got any,\" said her mother.\n\n\"Yes, I have; mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\npianos, and being afraid of people.\"\n\nBeth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh; but\nnobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\n\n\"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully. \"It is only another name for\ntrying to be good, and the story may help us; for though we do want to\nbe good, it's hard work, and we forget, and don't do our best.\"\n\n\"We were in the Slough of Despond to-night, and mother came and pulled\nus out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of directions,\nlike Christian. What shall we do about that?\" asked Jo, delighted with\nthe fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her\nduty.\n\n\"Look under your pillows, Christmas morning, and you will find your\nguide-book,\" replied Mrs. March.\n\nThey talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table; then\nout came the four little work-baskets, and the needles flew as the girls\nmade sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but to-night no\none grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long seams into\nfour parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,\nand in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked about the\ndifferent countries as they stitched their way through them.\n\n   [Illustration: No one but Beth could get much music out of the old\n                                 piano]\n\nAt nine they stopped work, and sung, as usual, before they went to bed.\nNo one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano; but she had a\nway of softly touching the yellow keys, and making a pleasant\naccompaniment to the simple songs they sung. Meg had a voice like a\nflute, and she and her mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a\ncricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always\ncoming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoilt the\nmost pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could\nlisp\n\n        \"Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,\"\n\nand it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.\nThe first sound in the morning was her voice, as she went about the\nhouse singing like a lark; and the last sound at night was the same\ncheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar\nlullaby.\n\n      [Illustration: At nine they stopped work and sung as usual]\n\n\n\n\n                   [Illustration: A Merry Christmas]\n\n                                   II.\n\n                           A MERRY CHRISTMAS.\n\n\nJo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No\nstockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much\ndisappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because\nit was so crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother's\npromise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little\ncrimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful\nold story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true\nguide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey.
