It was a most\nunfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had\nevidently taken his coffee too strong that morning; there was an east\nwind, which always affected his neuralgia; and his pupils had not done\nhim the credit which he felt he deserved: therefore, to use the\nexpressive, if not elegant, language of a school-girl, \"he was as\nnervous as a witch and as cross as a bear.\" The word \"limes\" was like\nfire to powder; his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with\nan energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.\n\n\"Young ladies, attention, if you please!\"\n\nAt the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,\ngray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.\n\n\"Miss March, come to the desk.\"\n\nAmy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed\nher, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.\n\n\"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,\" was the unexpected\ncommand which arrested her before she got out of her seat.\n\n\"Don't take all,\" whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence\nof mind.\n\nAmy hastily shook out half a dozen, and laid the rest down before Mr.\nDavis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when\nthat delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis\nparticularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust\nadded to his wrath.\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" stammered Amy.\n\n\"Bring the rest immediately.\"\n\nWith a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.\n\n\"You are sure there are no more?\"\n\n\"I never lie, sir.\"\n\n\"So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them\nout of the window.\"\n\nThere was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the\nlast hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.\nScarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times;\nand as each doomed couple--looking oh! so plump and juicy--fell from her\nreluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of the\ngirls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the\nlittle Irish children, who were their sworn foes. This--this was too\nmuch; all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable\nDavis, and one passionate lime-lover burst into tears.\n\nAs Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous \"Hem!\"\nand said, in his most impressive manner,--\n\n\"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry\nthis has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I\n_never_ break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand.\"\n\nAmy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring\nlook which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.\nShe was rather a favorite with \"old Davis,\" as, of course, he was\ncalled, and it's my private belief that he _would_ have broken his word\nif the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in\na hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible gentleman,\nand sealed the culprit's fate.\n\n\"Your hand, Miss March!\" was the only answer her mute appeal received;\nand, too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her\nhead defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her\nlittle palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no\ndifference to her. For the first time in her life she had been struck;\nand the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her\ndown.\n\n   [Illustration: Amy bore without flinching several tingling blows]\n\n\"You will now stand on the platform till recess,\" said Mr. Davis,\nresolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.\n\nThat was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, and\nsee the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her few\nenemies; but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her,\nseemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop\ndown where she stood, and break her heart with crying. A bitter sense of\nwrong, and the thought of Jenny Snow, helped her to bear it; and, taking\nthe ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove-funnel above what\nnow seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that\nthe girls found it very hard to study, with that pathetic figure before\nthem.\n\nDuring the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little\ngirl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. To others it\nmight seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard\nexperience; for during the twelve years of her life she had been\ngoverned by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her\nbefore. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten\nin the sting of the thought,--\n\n\"I shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!\"\n\nThe fifteen minutes seemed an hour; but they came to an end at last, and\nthe word \"Recess!\" had never seemed so welcome to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a young girl who is a student in Mr. Davis's class)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNY SNOW<|>PERSON<|>Jenny Snow is mentioned as a friend of Amy's)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
