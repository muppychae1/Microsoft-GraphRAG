She felt so ill one day\nthat she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to you,\nand the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake. She was\nsorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest of\nus, and her best love to grandpa. _She_ never thought of a will.\"\n\nLaurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a\ngreat tear dropped on the paper. Amy's face was full of trouble; but she\nonly said, \"Don't people put sort of postscripts to their wills,\nsometimes?\"\n\n\"Yes; 'codicils,' they call them.\"\n\n\"Put one in mine then--that I wish _all_ my curls cut off, and given\nround to my friends. I forgot it; but I want it done, though it will\nspoil my looks.\"\n\nLaurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he\namused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. But\nwhen he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper, with trembling lips,\n\"Is there really any danger about Beth?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid there is; but we must hope for the best, so don't cry,\ndear;\" and Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which\nwas very comforting.\n\nWhen he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and, sitting in the\ntwilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,\nfeeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the\nloss of her gentle little sister.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n         [Illustration: Mrs. March would not leave Beth's side]\n\n                                  XX.\n\n                             CONFIDENTIAL.\n\n\nI don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the\nmother and daughters; such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to\ndescribe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely\nsaying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg's\ntender hope was realized; for when Beth woke from that long, healing\nsleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell _were_ the little rose\nand mother's face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled, and\nnestled close into the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry\nlonging was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls\nwaited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which\nclung to hers even in sleep. Hannah had \"dished up\" an astonishing\nbreakfast for the traveller, finding it impossible to vent her\nexcitement in any other way; and Meg and Jo fed their mother like\ndutiful young storks, while they listened to her whispered account of\nfather's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to stay and nurse him, the delays\nwhich the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable\ncomfort Laurie's hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out\nwith fatigue, anxiety, and cold.\n\nWhat a strange, yet pleasant day that was! so brilliant and gay without,\nfor all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow; so quiet and\nreposeful within, for every one slept, spent with watching, and a\nSabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMY CURTIS MARCH<|>PERSON<|>Amy Curtis March is the writer of the will and testament dated November 20, 1861)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THEODORE LAURENCE<|>PERSON<|>Theodore Laurence is a witness to Amy Curtis March's will and testament)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESTELLE VALNOR<|>PERSON<|>Estelle Valnor is a witness to Amy Curtis March's will and testament)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is a character mentioned in the text who is ill and contemplating giving away her possessions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character mentioned in the text who is mentioned in relation to Beth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is a character mentioned in the text who is mentioned in relation to Beth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANNAH<|>PERSON<|>Hannah is a character mentioned in the text who prepares breakfast for the traveler)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY CURTIS MARCH<|>THEODORE LAURENCE<|>Theodore Laurence is a witness to Amy Curtis March's will and testament<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY CURTIS MARCH<|>ESTELLE VALNOR<|>Estelle Valnor is a witness to Amy Curtis March's will and testament<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>JO<|>Beth tells Jo about wanting to give away her possessions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>MEG<|>Beth wants to give her piano to Meg<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>HANNAH<|>Beth wants to give the patchwork to Hannah<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>JO<|>Meg and Jo wait upon their mother together<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEG<|>HANNAH<|>Meg and Jo feed their mother breakfast prepared by Hannah<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>HANNAH<|>Jo and Meg feed their mother breakfast prepared by Hannah<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
