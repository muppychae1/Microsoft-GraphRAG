I felt myself disgraced\n    and deserted forever, but didn't blame him a particle, and was\n    scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and\n    shake myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if\n    I'd covered myself with glory.\n\n    \"'Now we shall try a new way. You and I will read these pleasant\n    little MÃ¤rchen together, and dig no more in that dry book, that\n    goes in the corner for making us trouble.'\n\n    \"He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Andersen's fairy tales so\n    invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and\n    went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to\n    amuse him immensely. I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away\n    (no other word will express it) with all my might, tumbling over\n    long words, pronouncing according to the inspiration of the\n    minute, and doing my very best. When I finished reading my first\n    page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and cried\n    out, in his hearty way, 'Das ist gute! Now we go well! My turn.\n    I do him in German; gif me your ear.' And away he went, rumbling\n    out the words with his strong voice, and a relish which was good\n    to see as well as hear. Fortunately the story was the 'Constant\n    Tin Soldier,' which is droll, you know, so I could laugh,--and I\n    did,--though I didn't understand half he read, for I couldn't\n    help it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so\n    comical.\n\n    \"After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty\n    well; for this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the\n    grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills\n    in jelly. I like it very much, and he doesn't seem tired of it\n    yet,--which is very good of him, isn't it? I mean to give him\n    something on Christmas, for I dare not offer money. Tell me\n    something nice, Marmee.\n\n    \"I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up\n    smoking, and lets his hair grow. You see Beth manages him better\n    than I did. I'm not jealous, dear; do your best, only don't make\n    a saint of him. I'm afraid I couldn't like him without a spice\n    of human naughtiness. Read him bits of my letters. I haven't\n    time to write much, and that will do just as well. Thank Heaven\n    Beth continues so comfortable.\"\n\n\n                                                           \"JANUARY.\n\n    \"A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course\n    includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can't\n    tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn't\n    get it till night, and had given up hoping. Your letter came in\n    the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it\n    for a surprise; so I was disappointed, for I'd had a 'kind of a\n    feeling' that you wouldn't forget me. I felt a little low in my\n    mind, as I sat up in my room, after tea; and when the big,\n    muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged\n    it, and pranced. It was so _homey_ and refreshing, that I sat\n    down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and\n    cried, in my usual absurd way. The things were just what I\n    wanted, and all the better for being made instead of bought.\n    Beth's new 'ink-bib' was capital; and Hannah's box of hard\n    gingerbread will be a treasure. I'll be sure and wear the nice\n    flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books father\n    has marked.

I never knew how much\n    there was in Shakespeare before; but then I never had a Bhaer to\n    explain it to me.
