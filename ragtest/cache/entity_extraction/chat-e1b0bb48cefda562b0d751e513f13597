Remembering the conversation of the\nafternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the\nsacrifice cheerfully, \"I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old\ngentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has.\"\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                    [Illustration: Jo was very busy]\n\n                                  XIV.\n\n                                SECRETS.\n\n\nJo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow\nchilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the sun\nlay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,\nwriting busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,\nwhile Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied\nby his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of\nhis whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the\nlast page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish, and\nthrew down her pen, exclaiming,--\n\n\"There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have to wait till\nI can do better.\"\n\nLying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,\nmaking dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,\nwhich looked like little balloons; then she tied it up with a smart red\nribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression,\nwhich plainly showed how earnest her work had been. Jo's desk up here\nwas an old tin kitchen, which hung against the wall. In it she kept her\npapers and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being\nlikewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of\nsuch books as were left in his way, by eating the leaves. From this tin\nreceptacle Jo produced another manuscript; and, putting both in her\npocket, crept quietly down stairs, leaving her friends to nibble her\npens and taste her ink.\n\nShe put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and, going to\nthe back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung\nherself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.\nOnce there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled\naway to town, looking very merry and mysterious.\n\nIf any one had been watching her, he would have thought her movements\ndecidedly peculiar; for, on alighting, she went off at a great pace till\nshe reached a certain number in a certain busy street; having found the\nplace with some difficulty, she went into the door-way, looked up the\ndirty stairs, and, after standing stock still a minute, suddenly dived\ninto the street, and walked away as rapidly as she came. This\nmanœuvre she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a\nblack-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building\nopposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,\npulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if\nshe were going to have all her teeth out.\n\nThere was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,\nand, after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly\nopened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young\ngentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself\nin the opposite door-way, saying, with a smile and a shiver,--\n\n\"It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need some\none to help her home.\"\n\nIn ten minutes Jo came running down stairs with a very red face, and the\ngeneral appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying\nordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked\nanything but pleased, and passed him with a nod; but he followed, asking\nwith an air of sympathy,--\n\n\"Did you have a bad time?\"\n\n\"Not very.\"\n\n\"You got through quickly.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank goodness!\"\n\n\"Why did you go alone?\"\n\n\"Didn't want any one to know.\"\n\n\"You're the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out?\"\n\nJo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him; then began to\nlaugh, as if mightily amused at something.\n\n\"There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.\"\n\n\"What are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo,\" said\nLaurie, looking mystified.\n\n\"So are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?\"\n\n\"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a\ngymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and\nwe'll make a fine thing of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
