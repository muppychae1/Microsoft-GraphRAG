Just come and help me\n    put these books to rights, for I've turned everything upside\n    down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new\n    handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago.'\n\n    \"I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was 'a\n    den,' to be sure. Books and papers everywhere; a broken\n    meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantel-piece as if done\n    with; a ragged bird, without any tail, chirped on one\n    window-seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other;\n    half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the\n    manuscripts; dirty little boots stood drying before the fire;\n    and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave\n    of himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand\n    rummage three of the missing articles were found,--one over the\n    bird-cage, one covered with ink, and a third burnt brown, having\n    been used as a holder.\n\n    \"'Such a man!' laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the\n    relics in the rag-bag. 'I suppose the others are torn up to rig\n    ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite-tails. It's dreadful,\n    but I can't scold him: he's so absent-minded and good-natured,\n    he lets those boys ride over him rough-shod. I agreed to do his\n    washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I\n    forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.'\n\n    \"'Let me mend them,' said I. 'I don't mind it, and he needn't\n    know. I'd like to,--he's so kind to me about bringing my letters\n    and lending books.'\n\n    \"So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two\n    pairs of the socks,--for they were boggled out of shape with his\n    queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it\n    out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the\n    lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much\n    that I took a fancy to learn; for Tina runs in and out, leaving\n    the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this\n    door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what\n    he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had\n    gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was\n    busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most\n    absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was\n    Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to\n    Tina not to betray him.\n\n    \"'So!' he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, 'you peep\n    at me, I peep at you, and that is not bad; but see, I am not\n    pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?'\n\n    \"'Yes; but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn,' I\n    blundered out, as red as a peony.\n\n    \"'Prut! we will make the time, and we fail not to find the\n    sense. At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much\n    gladness; for, look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay,'\n    and he pointed to my work. 'Yes, they say to one another, these\n    so kind ladies, \"he is a stupid old fellow; he will see not what\n    we do; he will never opserve that his sock-heels go not in holes\n    any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall,\n    and believe that strings make theirselves.\" Ah! but I haf an\n    eye, and I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel the thanks for\n    this. Come, a little lesson then and now, or no more good fairy\n    works for me and mine.'\n\n    \"Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and as it really\n    is a splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began. I\n    took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog.\n    The Professor was very patient with me, but it must have been\n    torment to him, and now and then he'd look at me with such an\n    expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up with me whether\n    to laugh or cry. I tried both ways; and when it came to a sniff\n    of utter mortification and woe, he just threw the grammar on to\n    the floor, and marched out of the room. I felt myself disgraced\n    and deserted forever, but didn't blame him a particle, and was\n    scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and\n    shake myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if\n    I'd covered myself with glory.\n\n    \"'Now we shall try a new way. You and I will read these pleasant\n    little Märchen together, and dig no more in that dry\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MR.
