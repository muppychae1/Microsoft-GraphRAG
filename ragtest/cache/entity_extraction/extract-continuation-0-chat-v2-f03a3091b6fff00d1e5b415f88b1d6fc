Many of them! Thank you for our books; we read\nsome, and mean to every day,\" they cried, in chorus.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope\nyou will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far\naway from here lies a poor woman with a little new-born baby. Six\nchildren are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have\nno fire. There is nothing to eat over there; and the oldest boy came to\ntell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give\nthem your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"\n\nThey were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a\nminute no one spoke; only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously,--\n\n\"I'm so glad you came before we began!\"\n\n\"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\" asked\nBeth, eagerly.\n\n\"_I_ shall take the cream and the muffins,\" added Amy, heroically giving\nup the articles she most liked.\n\nMeg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one\nbig plate.\n\n\"I thought you'd do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \"You\nshall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and\nmilk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner-time.\"\n\nThey were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was\nearly, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and\nno one laughed at the queer party.\n\n                 [Illustration: The procession set out]\n\nA poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,\nragged bed-clothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,\nhungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.\n\nHow the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!\n\n\"Ach, mein Gott! it is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman,\ncrying for joy.\n\n\"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them laughing.\n\nIn a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work\nthere. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the\nbroken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother\ntea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she\ndressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The\ngirls, meantime, spread the table, set the children round the fire, and\nfed them like so many hungry birds,--laughing, talking, and trying to\nunderstand the funny broken English.\n\n\"Das ist gut!\" \"Die Engel-kinder!\" cried the poor things, as they ate,\nand warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.\n\nThe girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it\nvery agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a \"Sancho\" ever\nsince she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't\nget any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think\nthere were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry\nlittle girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves\nwith bread and milk on Christmas morning.\n\n\"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said\nMeg, as they set out their presents, while their mother was upstairs\ncollecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\n\nNot a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\nthe few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white\nchrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\nquite an elegant air to the table.\n\n\"She's coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for\nMarmee!\" cried Jo, prancing about, while Meg went to conduct mother to\nthe seat of honor.\n\nBeth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted\nescort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched;\nand smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents, and read the\nlittle notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new\nhandkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's\ncologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were\npronounced a \"perfect fit.\"\n\nThere was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the\nsimple, loving fashion which makes these home-festivals so pleasant at\nthe time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to\nwork.\n\nThe morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of\nthe day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities.
