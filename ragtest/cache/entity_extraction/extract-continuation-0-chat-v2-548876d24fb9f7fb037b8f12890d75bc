It was the best thing he could have done; far\nmore soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken\nsympathy, and, in the silence, learned the sweet solace which affection\nadministers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her,\nand looked up with a grateful face.\n\n   [Illustration: Gently stroking her head as her mother used to do]\n\n\"Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now; I don't feel so forlorn, and will try\nto bear it if it comes.\"\n\n\"Keep hoping for the best; that will help you, Jo. Soon your mother will\nbe here, and then everything will be right.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad father is better; now she won't feel so bad about leaving\nhim. Oh, me! it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and I\ngot the heaviest part on my shoulders,\" sighed Jo, spreading her wet\nhandkerchief over her knees to dry.\n\n\"Doesn't Meg pull fair?\" asked Laurie, looking indignant.\n\n\"Oh, yes; she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do; and she won't\nmiss her as I shall. Beth is my conscience, and I _can't_ give her up. I\ncan't! I can't!\"\n\nDown went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried\ndespairingly; for she had kept up bravely till now, and never shed a\ntear. Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he\nhad subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It\nmight be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it.\nPresently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, \"I don't think she\nwill die; she's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe\nGod will take her away yet.\"\n\n\"The good and dear people always do die,\" groaned Jo, but she stopped\ncrying, for her friend's words cheered her up, in spite of her own\ndoubts and fears.\n\n\"Poor girl, you're worn out. It isn't like you to be forlorn. Stop a\nbit; I'll hearten you up in a jiffy.\"\n\nLaurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down\non Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from the\ntable where she left it. It must have possessed some magic, for the\nsubmissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo; and, when\nLaurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a smile,\nand said bravely, \"I drink--Health to my Beth! You are a good doctor,\nTeddy, and _such_ a comfortable friend; how can I ever pay you?\" she\nadded, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her\ntroubled mind.\n\n\"I'll send in my bill, by and by; and to-night I'll give you something\nthat will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,\"\nsaid Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at\nsomething.\n\n\"What is it?\" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute, in her wonder.\n\n\"I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she'd come\nat once, and she'll be here to-night, and everything will be all right.\nAren't you glad I did it?\"\n\nLaurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for\nhe had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or\nharming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the moment\nhe stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his\nneck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, \"O Laurie! O mother! I _am_ so\nglad!\" She did not weep again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled\nand clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden\nnews. Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of\nmind; he patted her back soothingly, and, finding that she was\nrecovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo\nround at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away,\nsaying breathlessly, \"Oh, don't! I didn't mean to; it was dreadful of\nme; but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I\ncouldn't help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don't give me\nwine again; it makes me act so.\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. \"Why, you see I\ngot fidgety, and so did grandpa. We thought Hannah was overdoing the\nauthority business, and your mother ought to know. She'd never forgive\nus if Beth--well, if anything happened, you know. So I got grandpa to\nsay it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the office\nyesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my head off\nwhen I proposed a telegram. I never _can_ bear to be 'lorded over;' so\nthat settled my mind, and I did it.
