Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her\nlimited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to\nmake it, and, having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an\nearthquake, as a striking and appropriate _d√©nouement_. The manuscript\nwas privately despatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if\nthe tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect, she\nwould be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.\n\nSix weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to\nkeep a secret; but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all\nhope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which\nalmost took her breath away; for on opening it, a check for a hundred\ndollars fell into her lap. For a minute she stared at it as if it had\nbeen a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry. If the amiable\ngentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense\nhappiness he was giving a fellow-creature, I think he would devote his\nleisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement; for Jo valued the\nletter more than the money, because it was encouraging; and after years\nof effort it was _so_ pleasant to find that she had learned to do\nsomething, though it was only to write a sensation story.\n\n            [Illustration: A check for one hundred dollars]\n\nA prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed\nherself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the\nletter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won\nthe prize. Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story came\nevery one read and praised it; though after her father had told her that\nthe language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the tragedy\nquite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly way,--\n\n\"You can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and never mind the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"_I_ think the money is the best part of it. What _will_ you do with\nsuch a fortune?\" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a\nreverential eye.\n\n\"Send Beth and mother to the seaside for a month or two,\" answered Jo\npromptly.\n\n\"Oh, how splendid! No, I can't do it, dear, it would be so selfish,\"\ncried Beth, who had clapped her thin hands, and taken a long breath, as\nif pining for fresh ocean-breezes; then stopped herself, and motioned\naway the check which her sister waved before her.\n\n\"Ah, but you shall go, I've set my heart on it; that's what I tried for,\nand that's why I succeeded. I never get on when I think of myself alone,\nso it will help me to work for you, don't you see? Besides, Marmee needs\nthe change, and she won't leave you, so you _must_ go. Won't it be fun\nto see you come home plump and rosy again? Hurrah for Dr. Jo, who always\ncures her patients!\"\n\nTo the sea side they went, after much discussion; and though Beth didn't\ncome home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,\nwhile Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger; so Jo was\nsatisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with\na cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She\ndid earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the\nhouse; for by the magic of a pen, her \"rubbish\" turned into comforts for\nthem all. \"The Duke's Daughter\" paid the butcher's bill, \"A Phantom\nHand\" put down a new carpet, and the \"Curse of the Coventrys\" proved the\nblessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.\n\nWealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny\nside, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction\nwhich comes from hearty work of head or hand; and to the inspiration of\nnecessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful blessings of the\nworld. Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and ceased to envy\nricher girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could\nsupply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.\n\nLittle notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market; and,\nencouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and\nfortune. Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to all her\nconfidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling to three\npublishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she would cut\nit down one third, and omit all the parts which she particularly\nadmired.\n\n\"Now I must either bundle it back into my tin-kitchen to mould, pay for\nprinting it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers, and get what I can\nfor it. Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is more\nconvenient; so I wish to take the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a young woman who has won a writing prize and uses her prize money to help her family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is Jo's sister who benefits from Jo's prize money)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is another sister of Jo who admires Jo's prize money)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
