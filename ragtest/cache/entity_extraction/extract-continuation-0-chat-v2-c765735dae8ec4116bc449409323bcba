It took him a little\nwhile to recover from his surprise at the rapid cure of his first, and,\nas he had firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled himself\nfor the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost\nthe same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been\nimpossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well. His\nfirst wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon\nit as if through a long vista of years, with a feeling of compassion\nblended with regret. He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one of\nthe bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be grateful\nwhen the pain was over. His second wooing he resolved should be as calm\nand simple as possible; there was no need of having a scene, hardly any\nneed of telling Amy that he loved her; she knew it without words, and\nhad given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that\nno one could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased, even\nJo. But when our first little passion has been crushed, we are apt to be\nwary and slow in making a second trial; so Laurie let the days pass,\nenjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word\nthat would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance.\n\nHe had rather imagined that the _dénouement_ would take place in the\nchateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous\nmanner; but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was\nsettled on the lake, at noonday, in a few blunt words. They had been\nfloating about all the morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to sunny\nMontreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and the\nDent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne upon\nthe hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake\nbelow, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged\ngulls.\n\nThey had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of\nRousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his \"Héloise.\"\nNeither had read it, but they knew it was a love-story, and each\nprivately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. Amy had\nbeen dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell\nbetween them, and, when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars,\nwith an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for the\nsake of saying something,--\n\n\"You must be tired; rest a little, and let me row; it will do me good;\nfor, since you came, I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.\"\n\n\"I'm not tired; but you may take an oar, if you like. There's room\nenough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't\ntrim,\" returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.\n\nFeeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered third\nof a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar. She rowed\nas well as she did many other things; and, though she used both hands,\nand Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went smoothly\nthrough the water.\n\n               [Illustration: How well we pull together]\n\n\"How well we pull together, don't we?\" said Amy, who objected to silence\njust then.\n\n\"So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,\nAmy?\" very tenderly.\n\n\"Yes, Laurie,\" very low.\n\nThen they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little\n_tableau_ of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected\nin the lake.\n\n\n\n\n                                 XLII.\n\n                               ALL ALONE.\n\n\nIt was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in\nanother, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example; but when\nthe helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved\npresence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo\nfound her promise very hard to keep. How could she \"comfort father and\nmother,\" when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her\nsister; how could she \"make the house cheerful,\" when all its light and\nwarmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home\nfor the new; and where in all the world could she \"find some useful,\nhappy work to do,\" that would take the place of the loving service which\nhad been its own reward? She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her\nduty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust\nthat her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life\nget harder and harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all\nsunshine, and some all shadow;\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LAKE<|>GEO<|>The lake is a serene place that washes away troubles and inspires happy thoughts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOUNTAINS<|>GEO<|>The grand old mountains overlook the lake and seem to offer benevolent guidance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is a character who experiences a rapid change in his romantic feelings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is a character who struggles with loneliness and grief after her sister's departure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a character who shares a tender moment with Laurie on the lake)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>JO<|>Laurie experiences a change in romantic feelings towards Jo's sister, Amy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>LAURIE<|>Amy and Laurie share a tender moment on the lake<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JO<|>BETH<|>Jo struggles with loneliness and grief after her sister, Beth, leaves the old home<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
