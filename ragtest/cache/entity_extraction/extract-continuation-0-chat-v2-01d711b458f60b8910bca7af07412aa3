I don't know anything about them,\" thought\nBeth; and, forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry, she said,\nhoping to make him talk, \"I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you\nknow all about it.\"\n\n\"I did once; but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a\nconfounded five-barred gate; so there are no more horses and hounds for\nme,\" said Frank, with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her\ninnocent blunder.\n\n\"Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,\" she said, turning\nto the prairies for help, and feeling glad that she had read one of the\nboys' books in which Jo delighted.\n\nBuffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory; and, in her eagerness to\namuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her\nsisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking\naway to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged\nprotection.\n\n\"Bless her heart! She pities him, so she is good to him,\" said Jo,\nbeaming at her from the croquet-ground.\n\n\"I always said she was a little saint,\" added Meg, as if there could be\nno further doubt of it.\n\n\"I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,\" said Grace to\nAmy, as they sat discussing dolls, and making tea-sets out of the\nacorn-cups.\n\n\"My sister Beth is a very _fastidious_ girl, when she likes to be,\" said\nAmy, well pleased at Beth's success. She meant \"fascinating,\" but as\nGrace didn't know the exact meaning of either word, \"fastidious\" sounded\nwell, and made a good impression.\n\nAn impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet,\nfinished the afternoon. At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed,\nwickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the\nriver, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental,\nwarbled a serenade with the pensive refrain,--\n\n        \"Alone, alone, ah! woe, alone,\"\n\nand at the lines--\n\n       \"We each are young, we each have a heart,\n        Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?\"\n\nhe looked at Meg with such a lackadaisical expression that she laughed\noutright and spoilt his song.\n\n\"How can you be so cruel to me?\" he whispered, under cover of a lively\nchorus. \"You've kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day, and\nnow you snub me.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to; but you looked so funny I really couldn't help it,\"\nreplied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach; for it was\nquite true that she _had_ shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and\nthe talk after it.\n\nNed was offended, and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her\nrather pettishly, \"There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?\"\n\n\"Not a particle; but she's a dear,\" returned Sallie, defending her\nfriend even while confessing her short-comings.\n\n\"She's not a stricken deer, any way,\" said Ned, trying to be witty, and\nsucceeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.\n\nOn the lawn, where it had gathered, the little party separated with\ncordial good-nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada.\nAs the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked after\nthem, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, \"In spite of\ntheir demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when one knows\nthem.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said Mr. Brooke.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n           [Illustration: Swinging to and fro in his hammock]\n\n                                 XIII.\n\n                          CASTLES IN THE AIR.\n\n\nLaurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock, one warm\nSeptember afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too\nlazy to go and find out. He was in one of his moods; for the day had\nbeen both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could\nlive it over again. The hot weather made him indolent, and he had\nshirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,\ndispleased his grandfather by practising half the afternoon, frightened\nthe maid-servants half out of their wits, by mischievously hinting that\none of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stable-man\nabout some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his\nhammock, to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the\npeace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into\nthe green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams\nof all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean, in a\nvoyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a\nflash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches\ncoming out, as if bound on some expedition.\n\n\"What in the world are those girls about now?\" thought Laurie, opening\nhis sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather\npeculiar in the appearance of his neighbors.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BETH<|>PERSON<|>Beth is a compassionate and kind-hearted individual who is trying to engage with others)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANK<|>PERSON<|>Frank is a former hunter who can no longer participate in hunting due to an injury)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JO<|>PERSON<|>Jo is observing Beth's interactions with the boys and is pleased with her behavior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEG<|>PERSON<|>Meg is amused by the interactions between Beth and the boys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is pleased with Beth's success in engaging with others)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>FRANK<|>Beth unintentionally brings up a sensitive topic for Frank, causing him to express his inability to hunt<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>JO<|>Beth is engaging with one of the boys, which surprises Jo and Meg<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETH<|>AMY<|>Beth's actions are observed and appreciated by Amy<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
