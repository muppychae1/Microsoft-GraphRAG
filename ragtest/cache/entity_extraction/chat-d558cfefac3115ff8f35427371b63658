Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big,\nslippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 'aisy.'\"\n\n           [Illustration: Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish]\n\nWhen they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one;\nand, after a moment's thought, she said soberly,--\n\n\"As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets to-day, at the rooms, I felt\nvery anxious about father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should\nbe, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do; but I\nkept on worrying, till an old man came in, with an order for some\nclothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him; for he looked\npoor and tired and anxious.\n\n\"'Have you sons in the army?' I asked; for the note he brought was not\nto me.\n\n\"'Yes, ma'am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and\nI'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital,' he\nanswered quietly.\n\n\"'You have done a great deal for your country, sir,' I said, feeling\nrespect now, instead of pity.\n\n\"'Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am. I'd go myself, if I was any use;\nas I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'\n\n\"He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give\nhis all, that I was ashamed of myself. I'd given one man, and thought it\ntoo much, while he gave four, without grudging them. I had all my girls\nto comfort me at home; and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say\n'good by' to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy, thinking of my\nblessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and\nthanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.\"\n\n\"Tell another story, mother,--one with a moral to it, like this. I like\nto think about them afterwards, if they are real, and not too preachy,\"\nsaid Jo, after a minute's silence.\n\nMrs. March smiled, and began at once; for she had told stories to this\nlittle audience for many years, and knew how to please them.\n\n\"Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and\ndrink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and\nparents, who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.\" (Here\nthe listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew\ndiligently.) \"These girls were anxious to be good, and made many\nexcellent resolutions; but they did not keep them very well, and were\nconstantly saying, 'If we only had this,' or 'If we could only do that,'\nquite forgetting how much they already had, and how many pleasant things\nthey actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they could\nuse to make them happy, and she said, 'When you feel discontented, think\nover your blessings, and be grateful.'\" (Here Jo looked up quickly, as\nif about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story was not\ndone yet.)\n\n\"Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were\nsurprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that money\ncouldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses; another\nthat, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her youth,\nhealth, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady, who\ncouldn't enjoy her comforts; a third that, disagreeable as it was to\nhelp get dinner, it was harder still to have to go begging for it; and\nthe fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good\nbehavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings\nalready possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken\naway entirely, instead of increased; and I believe they were never\ndisappointed, or sorry that they took the old woman's advice.\"\n\n\"Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories\nagainst us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!\" cried Meg.\n\n\"I like that kind of sermon. It's the sort father used to tell us,\" said\nBeth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's cushion.\n\n\"I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more\ncareful than ever now; for I've had warning from Susie's downfall,\" said\nAmy morally.\n\n\"We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it. If we do, you just say\nto us, as old Chloe did in 'Uncle Tom,' 'Tink ob yer marcies, chillen!\ntink ob yer marcies!'\" added Jo, who could not, for the life of her,\nhelp getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though she took\nit to heart as much as any of them.\n\n                     [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                                   V.\n\n                           BEING NEIGHBORLY.\n\n\n                    [Illustration: Being neighborly]\n\n\"What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?\" asked Meg, one snowy\nafternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber\nboots, old sack and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the\nother.\n\n\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
