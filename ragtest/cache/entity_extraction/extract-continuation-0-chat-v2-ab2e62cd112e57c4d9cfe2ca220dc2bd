The air was dark\nwith Davises, and many Joneses gambolled like a flock of young giraffes.\nThe golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor, with a\ndashing Frenchwoman, who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train.\nThe Serene Teuton found the supper-table, and was happy, eating steadily\nthrough the bill of fare, and dismayed the _garçons_ by the ravages he\ncommitted. But the Emperor's friend covered himself with glory, for he\ndanced everything, whether he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu\npirouettes when the figures bewildered him. The boyish abandon of that\nstout man was charming to behold; for, though he \"carried weight,\" he\ndanced like an india-rubber ball. He ran, he flew, he pranced; his face\nglowed, his bald head shone; his coat-tails waved wildly, his pumps\nactually twinkled in the air, and when the music stopped, he wiped the\ndrops from his brow, and beamed upon his fellow-men like a French\nPickwick without glasses.\n\nAmy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm, but more\ngraceful agility; and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to\nthe rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as\nindefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished\nher, with assurances that he was \"desolated to leave so early,\" she was\nready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.\n\nIt had been successful; for, at three-and-twenty, blighted affections\nfind a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young\nblood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the\nenchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion. Laurie had a waked-up\nlook as he rose to give her his seat; and when he hurried away to bring\nher some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile,--\n\n\"Ah, I thought that would do him good!\"\n\n\"You look like Balzac's 'Femme peinte par elle-même,'\" he said, as he\nfanned her with one hand, and held her coffee-cup in the other.\n\n\"My rouge won't come off;\" and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and\nshowed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh\noutright.\n\n\"What do you call this stuff?\" he asked, touching a fold of her dress\nthat had blown over his knee.\n\n\"Illusion.\"\n\n\"Good name for it; it's very pretty--new thing, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's as old as the hills; you have seen it on dozens of girls, and you\nnever found out that it was pretty till now--_stupide_!\"\n\n\"I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, you see.\"\n\n\"None of that, it is forbidden; I'd rather take coffee than compliments\njust now. No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous.\"\n\nLaurie sat bolt upright, and meekly took her empty plate, feeling an odd\nsort of pleasure in having \"little Amy\" order him about; for she had\nlost her shyness now, and felt an irresistible desire to trample on him,\nas girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any\nsigns of subjection.\n\n\"Where did you learn all this sort of thing?\" he asked, with a quizzical\nlook.\n\n\"As 'this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would you kindly\nexplain?\" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but\nwickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.\n\n\"Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession,\nthe--the--illusion--you know,\" laughed Laurie, breaking down, and\nhelping himself out of his quandary with the new word.\n\nAmy was gratified, but, of course, didn't show it, and demurely\nanswered, \"Foreign life polishes one in spite of one's self; I study as\nwell as play; and as for this\"--with a little gesture toward her\ndress--\"why, tulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, and I am used\nto making the most of my poor little things.\"\n\nAmy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn't in good\ntaste; but Laurie liked her the better for it, and found himself both\nadmiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of\nopportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers.\nAmy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why he filled up\nher book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the rest of\nthe evening, in the most delightful manner; but the impulse that wrought\nthis agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which\nboth of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.\n\n\n\n\n                     [Illustration: Demi and Daisy]\n\n                                XXXVIII.\n\n                             ON THE SHELF.\n\n\nIn France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married,\nwhen \"_Vive la liberté_\" becomes their motto. In America, as every one\nknows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their\nfreedom with republican zest; but the young matrons usually abdicate\nwith the first heir to the throne, and go into a seclusion almost as\nclose as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet. Whether they\nlike it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DAVISES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Davises are a prominent family in the social scene)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JONESES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Joneses are another prominent family in the social scene)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCHWOMAN<|>PERSON<|>The Frenchwoman with the pink satin train is a notable figure in the social gathering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERENE TEUTON<|>PERSON<|>The Serene Teuton is a guest at the social event)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPEROR'S FRIEND<|>PERSON<|>The Emperor's friend is a lively dancer at the event)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY<|>PERSON<|>Amy is a key figure at the social gathering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURIE<|>PERSON<|>Laurie is involved in the social event)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VLADIMIR<|>PERSON<|>Vladimir is a guest at the social gathering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALZAC<|>PERSON<|>Balzac is referenced in a conversation at the event)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEMME PEINTE PAR ELLE-MÊME<|>PERSON<|>The reference to Femme peinte par elle-même in the conversation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ILLUSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Illusion is mentioned in the conversation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TULLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tulle is mentioned in the conversation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEMI<|>PERSON<|>Demi is a character in the story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAISY<|>PERSON<|>Daisy is a character in the story)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>LAURIE<|>Amy and Laurie interact and have a conversation at the event<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>ILLUSION<|>Amy mentions the concept of illusion in a conversation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>TULLE<|>Amy mentions tulle in a conversation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>ILLUSION<|>Amy refers to illusion in a conversation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>AMY<|>Laurie interacts with Amy at the event<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>ILLUSION<|>Laurie comments on the concept of illusion<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>TULLE<|>Laurie mentions tulle in a conversation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>ILLUSION<|>Laurie refers to illusion in a conversation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>BALZAC<|>Amy mentions Balzac in a conversation<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>FEMME PEINTE PAR ELLE-MÊME<|>Amy references Femme peinte par elle-même in a conversation<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>ILLUSION<|>Amy talks about the concept of illusion<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>TULLE<|>Amy mentions tulle in a conversation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>BALZAC<|>Laurie mentions Balzac in a conversation<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>FEMME PEINTE PAR ELLE-MÊME<|>Laurie references Femme peinte par elle-même in a conversation<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>ILLUSION<|>Laurie comments on the concept of illusion<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>TULLE<|>Laurie mentions tulle in a conversation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>ILLUSION<|>Laurie refers to illusion in a conversation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>DEMI<|>Amy interacts with Demi in the story<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY<|>DAISY<|>Amy interacts with Daisy in the story<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>DEMI<|>Laurie interacts with Demi in the story<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURIE<|>DAISY<|>Laurie interacts with Daisy in the story<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
